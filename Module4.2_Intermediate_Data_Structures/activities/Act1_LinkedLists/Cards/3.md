<!--concepts={Inserting Into a Linked List}-->

To begin inserting new nodes into the linked list, we'll create an `insert()` method! We will take data, initialize a new `Node` object with the data, then add it to the list. Although its possible to insert a new Node anywhere in the list, it becomes less expensive to insert it at the beginning.

If we had a string of pearls and wanted to add a new pearl, we would add the pearl at the start of the string, making our new pearl the "head" pearl. In the same sense, when inserting the new Node at the beginning, it becomes the new "head" of the list, and we can just have the next node (for our new "head") to point to the old "head" Node.

```python
def insert(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.set_next(self.head)
    self.head = new_node
```
Upon further observation, we can see that the time complexity for this insert method is in fact constant O(1): it always takes the same amount of time. It can only take one data point, create only one node, and doesn't need to interact with the other nodes in the linked list besides the "head" node.

When calling the `insert()` function in the `main()` code, it will look like this:

```python
film.insert(930)
```
<img src="../images/3_1.jpg" style="zoom:25%;" />

The data point '930' will be assigned to a new node's `self.data` value, while the `set_next` function points the current node to the old "head" node. Then, `self.head` will take in our current Node as the new "head" node. Now, the new "head" is the node with data 930 and this node points to the node with data 900.

The same will happen to the data entry of '1000' if we write  the following line.

```python
film.insert(1000)
```

<img src="../images/3_2.jpg" style="zoom:25%;" />

The node with '1000'  will become our new "head" and it will points to the node with '930'.
