Sites often have sign-up pages with input fields for your email or username and password. In this exercise, we'll discuss how you can create such HTML elements.

First of all, we need to start from `<form>` element, which represents a document section that contains interactive controls to submit information  to a web server.

A `<form>` element has a lot of attributes, here are the most important of them:

* **action** - The URL of a program that processes the form information.
* **method** - The HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are: 
  * post - corresponds to the HTTP POST method
  * get -   corresponds to the HTTP GET method.
* name - The name of the form. It must be unique among the forms in a document.
