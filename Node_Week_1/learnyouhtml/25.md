Now that you know what `<form>` is, you need to know what `<input>` is. Input is the element used in order to accept data from the user. How an `<input>` works varies considerably depending on the value of its type attribute.

Below there is a list of widely used type values:

* **text** - a single-line text field. Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value. Text is the default type value for input.

* **button** - a push button with no default behavior.

* **checkbox** - a check box. You must use the value attribute to define the value submitted by this item. Use the checked attribute to indicate whether this item is selected.

* **file** - a control that lets the user select a file.

* **password** - a single-line text field whose value is obscured.

* **radio** - a radio button. You must use the value attribute to define the value submitted by this item. Use the checked attribute to indicate whether this item is selected by default.

*  **submit** - a button that submits the form.
