## STYLES AND SCRIPTS

 ### Scripts

Besides styles, you are also able to include some JavaScript logic in an HTML document. Here's where `<script>` tag comes to help us.

The `<script>` element is used to embed or reference an executable script. It has few important attributes:

* **src** - this attribute specifies the URI of an external script; this can be used as an alternative to embedding a script directly within a document. If a script element has a src attribute specified, it should not have a script embedded inside its tags.
* **type** - this attribute identifies the scripting language of code embedded within a script element or referenced via the element’s src attribute.
* **type** - this attribute identifies the scripting language of code embedded within a script element or referenced via the element’s src attribute.
* **async** - set this Boolean attribute to indicate that the browser should, if possible, execute the script asynchronously.
* **defer** - this Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed.



Here is an example of inline script:

```html
<script>
	console.log('Hello, world!');
</script>
```

Reference script in external file:

```html
<script src="javascript.js"></script>
```

Note: It's better to include scripts before closing of `<body>` element.
