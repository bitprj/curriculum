In some cases you need to implement glossary or to display a list of key-value pairs. There is `<dl>` tag for such needs. `<dl>` stands for definitions list and is used to encloses a list of groups of terms and descriptions.

Terms are enclosed in `<dt>` tag, which means definition term. Definitions are wrapped in `<dd> ` tags.

Example with single term and description:

```html
<dl>
	<dt>HTML</dt>
	<dd>
		The standard markup language for
		creating web pages and web applications.
    </dd>
    <!-- Other terms and descriptions -->
</dl>
```



Also, you can write multiple terms with a single definition, single term with multiple definitions or multiple terms with multiple definitions.
