## Lancaster Stemmer

Now let's try another stemmer called the Lancaster Stemmer.

Like for the Porter Stemmer we just did, we want to import it and make an object of it.

	from nltk.stem import LancasterStemmer
	lst = LancasterStemmer()

Now let's try to do the same and try printing out the origins of the list of "give" and see what Lancaster Stemmer does.

	for words in word_to_stem:
		print(words + ": " + les.stem(words))

Output: 

- give: giv
- giving: giv
- given: giv
- gave: giv

This actaully outputs differently. From here, you can tell the Lancaster stemmer returns a more general output of a origin that might not be a word. On the other hand, Porter returns origins where each word, even though they all originated from give, had different outputted origins.
