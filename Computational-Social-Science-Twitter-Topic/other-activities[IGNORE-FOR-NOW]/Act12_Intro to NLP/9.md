### Bigrams, trigrams, ngrams

Bigrams, trigrams, and ngrams are simply groups of tokens. Before we were working with a single token, but lets say we wanted to have a pair of tokens. This is called a Bigram and can be done with:

``` python
from nltk import bigrams, trigrams, ngrams
```

Let's create a string

```python
string = "AI programs can absorb new modifications by putting highly independent pieces of information together. Hence you can modify even a minute piece of information of program without affecting its structure.""
```

First lets tokenize our string like so: 

```python
quotes_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(string)
```

Now we will use the functions we imported.

For a bigram we can use

```Python
quotes_bigrams = list(nltk.bigrams(quotes_tokens))
```

Trigram:

```python
quotes_trigrams = list(nltk.trigrams(quotes_tokens))
```

Ngrams:

```python
quotes_ngrams = list(nltk.ngrams(quotes_token,#length here 
                                ))
```

`Ngrams` takes in to two parameters. The first is the token list and the second is how many tokens you want in your group. If we inserted 2, we would have a bigram.
