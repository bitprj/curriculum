How to attack and own a machine running vulnerable services

##### What is command injection?

- Check the vulnerable webapp first
- http://daviscybersec.ddns.net:8079/commandinjection.php
- The webserver is probably executing something like “calculator {INPUT}”
- What happens if your input contains weird characters?
- “calculator 1+1 ; evil_command”
- Both commands get executed!
- There are many ways to detect command injection vulns, most importantly throw “metacharacters” at it (e.g. quotes and semicolons)
- The same concept is used for other injections like SQL injection

DISCLAIMER:

You WILL be gaining root access on the server, so please be courteous of others. Don’t be a jerk and run ‘rm -rf /’, or put rootkits, or add junk into .bashrc, or add this device to your botnet collection, etc. All other devices on the network is out of bounds, too.

SSH into [revshell@daviscybersec.ddns.net](mailto:revshell@daviscybersec.ddns.net)

Password: daviscybersec

You can listen on ports on 192.168.1.200 to the vulnerable webservice.

Server you are attacking:

http://daviscybersec.ddns.net:8079/commandinjection.php

Try injecting commands, get a reverse shell, and gain root!
