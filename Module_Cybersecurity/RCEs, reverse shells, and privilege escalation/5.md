# Jackpot!

- We just found something by running sudo -l

- What is setcap anyways?

- Some of you might be familiar with the SUID/SGID bit

- - You thought there are 9 permission bits? there are actually 12!

  - Three hidden bits, which allow the binary to be run as another user

  - This is useful for example on ping binaries, ping actually requires root privileges to run, so it’s SUID on some old systems

  - - This also means if you find a bug in the ping binary, you can exploit it and get root!

##### Capabilities

- Since SUID binaries are such a huge vulnerability, modern linux systems have something called “capabilities” instead
- ping now has CAP_NET_RAW which allows it to send raw network packets
- There are lots of capabilities, but the interesting one here is CAP_SETUID
- It allows the binary to set it’s user ID as anything! Including 0, which is root!
- How can we exploit this?

##### Writing a SUID shell

- Go into /tmp, make a directory for yourself so you won’t interfere with others
- Write a C program that calles setuid(0); then executes /bin/sh
- Compile
- Use the sudo vulnerability you just found and allow it to SUID to root
- Run it!
