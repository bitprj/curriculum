# Linux file permissions

All files have an owner and a set of “permissions” telling the system who is allowed to access what. They’re usually expressed in 3 octal numbers (ranging from 0~7), so 000 ~ 777
- Each number specifies “read”, “write” and “execute” permissions
  - Read=4, write=2, execute=1
- If you see 5, 5=4+1 so it corresponds to read and execute. 0 is no permissions, 7 is all

Each of the three numbers specify what the owner, group and world can do
  - You can check this info in ‘ls -l’ or ‘stat’ commands
  - This is all very abstract, so let’s go through an example!

###### Commands to Use

chmod
- Changes permissons of a file
  - Multiple usages
 - chmod 755 file
  - chmod u-x file
  - check the man page for them all!

chown
- Changes owner and group of a file
	- Usually only doable as root (unless you’re the owner and in the group you want to change to)
  - chown user:group file
