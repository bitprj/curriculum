# Bash

##### What is bash?

Bash is a “shell”, which is just a special program that gets your commands and executes them. It’s the most handy tool when you don’t have a graphical interface (minimal system, accessing via SSH, etc).

There are alternative shells, like csh or ksh or tcsh, but bash is the most common and the one you’re likely using now.

Different shells have different syntax, but most of the stuff today will be universal across all of them
- You can press ‘tab’ to autocomplete your commands!
  - This will speed things up drastically

##### Help with Bash

man

- Arguably the most important command, since it shows you a help message for the command
  - man ls
  - To exit the help message, press ‘q’.

help

- for internal commands, like ‘cd’ or ‘pwd’
