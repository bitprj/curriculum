# Basic Bash Commands

##### Navigating in Bash

pwd - print working directory
- - This is the directory (folder) you’re currently ‘in’
  - All commands operate from this directory, like ‘ls’

cd - change directory
- If you’re in /home/user, typing ‘cd test’ will put your current working directory as /home/user/test
- You can also use .. to move up directories, more on that later

ls - list files
- - By default, it lists files in the current directory
  - Has tons of features, like -l for long output(more information), and -a for showing hidden files

Hidden and special files:
- - All files and directories starting with a dot will be hidden files, like .file or .dir
  - - They’re visible if you use -a when using ls
  - There are two special ‘folders’ in each directory
  - - The folder . refers to the current directory, i.e. ‘cd .’ won’t do anything
  - The folder .. refers to the parent directory, so if you’re in /home/user, typing ‘cd ..’ will put you in /home

ls - list files
- By default, it lists files in the current directory

##### Looking at files

cat
- Has nothing to do with the animal, stands for ‘conCATenate’
- Prints out the entire contents of one or more files
- Useful, but don’t use it to print too much data or binary junk!

less
-This command allows you to scroll through the file!
- Use ↑ and ↓ to scroll around line by line, or use PgUp and PgDn to scroll through pages
- Press q to quit
- Other features I’m not gonna talk about -- read the man page!

file
- Tries to tell you what kind of file this is, whether it’s just text or an executable or a picture.
- Useful when you don’t know what it is and don’t want to cat it because it’s big!

head / tail
- Prints out the first / last 10 lines of the file
- You can specify how many lines you want by using -n [number]
- Useful when you only care about one part of the file

grep
- This is an extremely powerful tool, but for now it just searches strings inside files
  -  grep ‘pattern’ file
  -  example:

##### Moving Files

cp - copy
- cp [source] [destination]
  - Note: to copy recursively (copy all files in subdirectory), use -r

mv - move
- mv [source] [destination]
  - No need to use -r, it just moves the entire directory

rm - delete
- rm [file]
	- Use -r to delete recursively

WARNING: There is no confirmation for any of these commands! Run them when you’re sure what you’re doing! You can easily overwrite or delete files!
There’s no “recycle bin” in Linux, once you rm a file it’s gone!

-  Be extra careful around wildcards (*)
