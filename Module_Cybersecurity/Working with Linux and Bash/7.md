# Putting it to the test

Once you’re ready, take a crack at the service! Information on the right.

- Try to solve it yourself first, I’ll walk everyone through it after 30 minutes. Good luck!

We learned a lot about basic commands, some more advanced bash skills, and how file permissions and processes work.

There are many more advanced features I didn’t talk about, like command return values, environment variables, wildcards, command substitution, etc, but you can read more on your own!

When in doubt, always use ‘man’ and ‘help’!

##### Stuck?

- Getting help: man
- Moving around: ls, cd, pwd
- Looking at files: cat, less, file stat, head, tail, grep
- Process control: ps, kill
- User information: whoami id
- Piping: | (command shift the key above your enter key on the keyboard)
- Bash job control: &, ^Z, fg, bg, jobs
