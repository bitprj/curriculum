# Advanced bash skills

You can “chain” commands together using “pipes”, |

- command 1 | command 2 | command 3

  - This links the output of command 1 into the input of command 2, and so on

- This allows many possibilities!

- Trying to find a running process?

  - ps aux | grep command

- Trying to find something only in the first 300 lines of a file? 

  - head -n300 file | grep something

- You can also “background” processes while they’re running!

- If you want to run something while another command is running, you don’t have to kill that command!

  - Press Ctrl+Z, which “stops” the command
  - Type ‘fg’ to bring it back to the foreground again!
  - Type ‘bg’ to resume it running, but still free up the shell to execute other commands

- Use the ‘jobs’ command to view all the stopped/backgrounded jobs on the system

- Use ‘fg [number]’ or ‘bg [number]’ to resume that particular job
