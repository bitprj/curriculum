# Side Channel Attacks

Writing a time-base side channel exploit

##### Setup

You should have python and pwntools installed, from the “talking to remote servers” workshop.

Any other way of programmatically talking to servers is fine too, but I’m using python and pwntools today. Feel free to show off your exploit if you write it in another language!

##### What’s a side channel?

- Anything that is not what you directly get / not what the service intend for you to get

- Timing, power consumption...

- You are looking at side channels in your everyday lives!

- - People’s facial expressions in conversation
