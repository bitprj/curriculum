# Return Oriented Programming

- By chaining a chunk of code that sets rdi, with a chunk of code that uses it to execute /bin/bash, we have gained code execution!

- - We didn’t limit ourselves and jumped to the *middle* of functions, using snippets of code to do whatever we want to do (in this case, set %rdi).
  - These snippets of code are called “gadgets”. A gadget is just a snippet of code that ends in “ret”, so you can chain them together.

- The more complex a binary is, the more gadgets there are.

- - In fact, libc (the library that has printf, scanf, fopen and all the functions you know and love) has so many gadgets in it, it is actually turing complete!

- In fact, if you have a binary using libc, you don’t even *need* a target function!

- - system, execve, syscall rop gadget…
  - This is called a ret2libc attack
