Return Oriented Programming



- Remember last time we solved x86_bufov_args, and I told you it’s not possible in 64-bit?

- - I lied. We’re gonna exploit 2_x64_bufov_args together today! Source code is bufov_args.c

- The main obstacle for us last time was the x64 calling convention, which puts the arguments in registers rather than on the stack.

- - We can’t modify registers just by controlling the stack… unless we redirect code execution to some piece of code that *can* control the registers.

- Remember, our goal is to: put the right argument in %rdi, and run target

- - So, if we can find a “function” to move what we want into %rdi, we’re golden!

  - - Something along the lines of “pop %rdi” would be cool….

- What if I tell you there is a code section that looks like this:

- - 0x401273: pop %rdi
  - 0x401274: ret

- Does this allow you to put something in %rdi and jump to target?

- - Try it for yourself first before I reveal the solution.
