# Chaining functions

- Notice that after callmefirst has done its job, it does what every function does: look for the “saved return value” on the stack.

- - Can you use this to figure out how to call the three functions one after the other?

- You might have noticed we are sort of “programming” on the stack!

- - You gave instructions to the program to execute some functions in order by modifying return addresses and chaining the “ret”s at the end of the functions together.
  - This is *almost* return-oriented programming

- However, we had one arbitrary limitation, we tried to jump to beginnings of functions that exist…

- - but what if we can jump to the middle of functions?
