# Summary

- Last week we learned unprotected buffers are BAD. Now they’re WORSE!

- If an attacker finds your stack buffer overflow, they can get remote code execution even if your functions don’t do anything malicious!

- - They can just find enough ROP gadgets to screw you over.

- Protections?

- - Same stuff as last time, ASLR, canaries, etc, but the best protection is still to write better code.
  - Code like you’re being attacked, because you will be.
