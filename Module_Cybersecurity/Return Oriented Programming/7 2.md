# Finding ROP Gadgets

- Before you go on and do your own exploits, there’s one final thing…

- - I gave you the answer for where the crucial ROP gadget is, but how can you find it yourself?

- There’s a useful tool called (for obvious reasons) “ROPgadget”

- - pip install ropgadget

- You can ask ROPgadget to list stuff of interest by using:

- - ROPgadget --binary executable_to_analyze
  - Then you can grep for the stuff you might need
