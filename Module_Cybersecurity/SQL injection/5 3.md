# Blind SQL injection

- Final challenge! https://bsqli.rkevin.dev

- Sometimes you don’t get to dump all the information nicely like the inventory search tool. Sometimes you don’t get any information at all other than if the query succeeded or not! How do we deal with this then?

- - This is called blind SQL injection

- We can still use many queries and figure out what values are in the table

- - For example, if a table has a row with secret_value=5

  - - SELECT * FROM table WHERE secret_value < 0; will fail
    - SELECT * FROM table WHERE secret_value > 0; will succeed

- There are also LIKE statements and STRCMP functions to match strings

- - SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE “_abc%”

  - - “_” matches any one character, “%” matches zero or more

  - SELECT * FROM table WHERE STRCMP(name, “abc”)=-1
