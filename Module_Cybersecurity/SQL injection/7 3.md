# Summary

- SQL is extremely common, and it’s very important to implement it right.

- How can we defend against this?

- - SANITIZE USER INPUT!

  - - This applies not only to SQL, not only to webapp development, but literally everything
    - When you think about it, all exploits are bad users giving unexpected input :p

  - Prepared statements

  - - There’s a way to tell MySQL to make a “prepared statement”
    - SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?
    - The ? is filled in by MySQL, no injections here no matter what bad characters are there.
