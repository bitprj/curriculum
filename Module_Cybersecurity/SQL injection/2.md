# Breaking into a login page

- Vulnerable service: https://sqli.rkevin.dev/

- - Initial page load will take ~10s, be patient!

- This login page, like some other badly written ones, tries to select rows from a database of users that match the username and password. If there are no matches, you can’t login.

- Can you think of a way to break it?

- BTW, something convenient: You can end your query using a semicolon, then using “-- “ to comment out the junk after the statement (like // in C)

- - Note the space after the “-- “! “--” will fail but “-- “ will work

- Hint: The query being executed is

- - SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=’$username’ AND password=’$pass’
