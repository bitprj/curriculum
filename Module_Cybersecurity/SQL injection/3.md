# Enumerating the database

- We’re in! Also we can see some output from the database. How can we use this to exfiltrate information from the database?

- UNION

- - This is a SQL command that “joins” two SELECT statements and gives back the results
  - SELECT col1,col2 FROM table1 UNION SELECT col3,col4 FROM table2
  - Caveat is both SELECT statements must return the same amount of columns

- You can also SELECT “constants”

- - SELECT 1,2,username FROM users

  - - Will return 3 columns, the first two are hardcoded 1 and 2 for all the rows.

- Knowing all this, and if I tell you the usernames and passwords are stored in a table called “users”, can you exfiltrate all the user info?

- We got some usernames and passwords! However, we just guessed the table name and the column names. Who knows what kind of stuff is hidden in the database…

- information_schema

- - This is a special database that contains all the information for all other databases and tables!
  - If you know the underlying database (MariaDB) you can just Google to see how its structured.

- information_schema.tables

- - Contains info on all tables in the system

  - Two important columns: table_name, table_schema

  - - table_name is (duh) the table name, table_schema is which database the table is in

- information_schema.columns

- - column_name, table_name

  - - You can also use WHERE statements to filter by table_name
