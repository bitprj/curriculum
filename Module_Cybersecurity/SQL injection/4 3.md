# File inclusion

- We can read any table in the system. Can we read more?

- MariaDB/MySQL has a load_file function

- - Other databases like PostgreSQL have similar functions, even up to RCE
  - If you’re running a database, MAKE SURE no one can access it! It could mean more than just your database being compromised.

- We can probably dump the PHP code and see how the webapp works!

- - The third and last flag (for this challenge) is waiting for you…
  - NOTE: The default Apache webpages are served from /var/www/html
  - NOTE: Ignore the /webchal/lfi part, the files are in places like /var/www/html/index.php

- You can also write to files, although you can’t append or overwrite files

- - Google to see more information!
  - I’m not sure how to get RCE from this, but if you can figure it out I’d like to know!
