# Accessing the control panel

- We want to access controlpanel.redshift.org:80, how will you do that?

- - -L 8001:controlpanel.redshift.org:80

- Try opening localhost:8001 in your browser. The traffic should be routed correctly

- We can SSH into the workstation using the private keys we got from James’ computer.

- I won’t be giving the solution directly, try to figure it out on your own!

- - But feel free to ask questions!
