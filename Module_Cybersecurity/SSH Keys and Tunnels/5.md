# Local port forwarding

- To do local port forwarding:

- - ssh -L port:host:hostport user@server
  - port is a port on your local machine
  - host:hostport is the destination you are connecting to
  - For example, -L 1234:10.0.0.1:5678 will make it so that whenever you access port 1234 on your local computer, it would be like the server accessed port 5678 on the computer 10.0.0.1
  - I admit this is kind of confusing, but the next slide should clear it up.

##### -L 1234:10.0.0.1:5678
