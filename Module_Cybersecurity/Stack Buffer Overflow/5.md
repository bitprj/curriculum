# x86 Calling Conventions

- When you call a function, the “return address” (aka where you would continue executing) is pushed onto the stack

- - This way the function you’re calling knows where to continue execution once it’s finished

- esp (stack pointer) and ebp (base pointer) are kept the same before and after the function call

- - There are some other registers that are supposed to be the same, but it’s not important here

- Let’s take a look at test2, which is nearly the same as test1, but it’s important to understand this part first so let’s go through the example again.
