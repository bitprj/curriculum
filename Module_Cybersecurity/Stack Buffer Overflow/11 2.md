# x86 Calling Conventions

- For each function, the local variables are stored on the stack “before” the return address and stored base pointer. Here’s a quick summary of what the stack looks like from the caller and callee’s perspective.

| First argument (esp) |
| -------------------- |
| ...                  |
| Last argument        |
| Caller’s stuff       |
| Caller’s stuff (ebb) |

Caller, right before the “call” instruction

| Local variable (...) (ESP)  |
| --------------------------- |
| Local variable (ebb)        |
| Saved ebp                   |
| Saved return address        |
| First argument              |
| … (all the other arguments) |
