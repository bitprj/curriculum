# Buffer Overflow

- We saw several things when learning about the call conventions:

- - Where we should jump to next is just stored on the stack, like any other value
  - Local variables are stored “before” the return address

- Can we exploit this somehow?

- Consider this piece of code:

- - char buf[16];
  - scanf(“%s”, buf);

- Could this cause any problems?

- Hint: The stack looks like this:

- If we write more data than the program expects, we can overwrite the saved return address and gain control of the program’s execution!      

| Buffer (local variable) |
| ----------------------- |
| ...                     |
| Buffer (local variable) |
| Saved ebp               |
| Saved return address    |
| … (all the other stuff) |



- Let’s try exploiting this “control flow hijack” vulnerability.

- - It’s called this because we gain control of “eip”, which controls where the program executes next. If we hijack eip, we hijack what the program is gonna execute next.

- Take a look at 3_x86_bufov_noargs, and think about how you can exploit it

- - Try entering some crap into it and see how it behaves!

- If you enter in a long string, you will see the program crashes! Let’s investigate where it crashed...
- As you can see, our instruction pointer got overwritten to our input! Why does this happen? Let’s look at the disassembly again...
