# Summary

- Unprotected buffers are BAD!

- - We explored how overwriting stuff on the stack can lead to running code on a vulnerable server, but other types of overflows (e.g. heap) are equally as bad!

- Protections?

- - Write secure code! Never trust user input, filter stuff properly, check length, etc.
  - System/hardware level protections: ASLR, canaries, shadowstack…
  - This is an old problem, so there are many solutions, each of them are worth talking about some other time.
