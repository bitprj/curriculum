# Assembly x86 Calling Conventions

Let’s make some programs and see how calling works when compiled by GCC.
- Different compilers will give different disassemblies, but the convention should be the same. 

Take a look at calling_convention.c and 1_x86_convention.

- main:

- - 0x80491b1: call test1
  - 0x80491b6: some other instruction

- test1:

- - 0x8049166: push %ebp
  - 0x8049167: mov %esp, %ebp
  - 0x8049169: nop
  - 0x804916a: pop %ebp
  - 0x804916b: ret
