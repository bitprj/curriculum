# Reverse shell

- We can execute code on the server!
- Use the skills from the last workshop and get yourself a reverse shell!
- If you need a refresher or just some common reverse shells: http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet or just google “reverse shell cheat sheet”
- I recommend using the php one since we know php is on the system, but we are not sure if other tools are(you can always use the which command to check)
