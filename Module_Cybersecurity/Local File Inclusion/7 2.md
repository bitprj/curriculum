# Jackpot!

- We got a reverse shell and the second flag!

- The third flag is hidden deeper, but I won’t tell you where it is just yet. Happy hunting!

- To summarize, we found a vulnerability where we can read arbitrary files, used it to extract information from the system, and eventually gained RCE from access.log

- If you are a developer

- - ALWAYS sanitize your inputs!
  - Don’t just run dangerous functions like include() with user input
  - Consider moving your log files to a non-standard location
