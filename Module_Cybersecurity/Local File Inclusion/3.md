# PHP

##### Reading PHP source

- If we can read arbitrary files, why not see what the webserver is doing?
- ../../../var/www/html/index.php
- However the results are a mess!
- This is because the webserver still recognizes <?php ?> tags and will execute them as code instead of displaying them
- How can we get around this restriction?

##### PHP filters

- If we don’t let the webserver see the php tags, we can exfiltrate the source code
- So we need to encode it somehow…
- PHP filters can actually convert the file into base64!
- php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=file
- There are other useful PHP filters(like zipping/unzipping) that could help you bypass security checks and exfiltrate/execute files
