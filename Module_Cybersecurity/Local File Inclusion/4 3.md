# RCE through log files

- So we got the source code, but nothing interesting inside.
- Can we turn our LFI into an RCE?
- If you read the log file, the server prints out a bunch of stuff, including our user agent
- What if our user agent is “<?php pwn(); ?>”
- This is the part where you can mess up. If you make a request like this using syntactically incorrect PHP code, it can make this attack undoabe. Tell me if you need the container reset!
- <?php echo exec(‘id’) ?>
