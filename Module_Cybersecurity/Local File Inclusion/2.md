# Local File Inclusion

##### What is local file inclusion (LFI)?

Check the vulnerable webapp first

Info for people following along AFTER the workshop:

Two containers are still running on ports 10001 and 10002. If you want to use them, feel free to ask me to reset them for you.

##### No such file or directory…?

- The most important thing when pentesting a system is to see how it behaves when given unexpected input
- If we enter a name that is not in the roster, we get a “file not found” error
- This means it’s very likely that the server is just opening a file and sending us the contents

##### ../profit

- From the error we can see the server is reading files from /home/professor/grades
- Can we access other files on the system?
- /home/professor/grades/../../../etc/passwd
- If you don’t have the error logs, don’t worry! The root directory still has a .. that points to itself, so just rack up a bajillion ../../../s

##### What next?

- We can read arbitrary files on the system! What should we read though?

- /etc/passwd

- - Contains user account info

- /etc/[random config files]

- - If file found, the system has that service installed
  - Could also give you useful info

- /proc/self/

- - This is a bit advanced, but you theoretically could gain RCE using /proc/self/environ, read own memory from /proc/self/mem, etc

- Source code and log files

- - We will cover these two in more detail
