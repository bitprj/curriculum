# How do you know what’s open?

- nmap scans the commonly used ports, but what if there’s an uncommon one?
- Use the -p flag to specify a port range, for example “-p 100,200,300-600” scans ports 100 and 200 as well as every port in between 300 and 600
- To scan all ports, use -p-
- There’s a port in the 5000-5100 range, can you find it?

- By default, nmap tells you nothing about the services behind the ports
- When you see HTTP, it might not actually be a webserver that’s running on port 80
- use -sV to scan with version information, although this will take longer to finish
- What server is running on port 80?
