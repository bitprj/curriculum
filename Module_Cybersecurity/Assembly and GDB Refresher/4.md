# Basic assembly instructions

Let’s take a look at some actual assembly code!

The tool ‘objdump’ dumps assembly from an executable binary. Try running ‘objdump -d 1_basic’ to dump its assembly.
- We’re only interested in the ‘main’ section

Open ‘1_basic.c’ side by side to compare the assembly and the C source code!

##### Basic Instructions

- mov src,dest : Moves src into dest (note the order!)
- call addr: Calls the function at addr, with the arguments passed through registers
- Fetching the value in a memory address
- -0x4(%rbp) means go to the address %rbp-4, and grab the value there

Note: This is where x86 and x64 differ, but we’ll go through that and what ‘call’ does exactly in the next workshop!

Now let’s check the disassembly for 2_if
- cmp a,b: Does b-a and stores “flags” about the calculation
- jl: Jump if last cmp was less than zero
- jg: Jump if greater
- jle/jge: Jump if less/greater than or equal

##### Loops

‘objdump -d 3_loop’
What does a loop look like in assembly?
start of loop:
    loop_body
    cmp ?,?
    jump to start of loop if sth happens
after_loop

In general, when you’re reversing a binary, it’s very important to watch for call and jump instructions
Instructions like mov, lea, push and pull are linear, but jumps and calls indicate logic like if statements and loops
