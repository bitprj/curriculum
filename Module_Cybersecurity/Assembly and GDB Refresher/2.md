# Why are we interested in assembly?

When you get a program, it might not come with source code, but it definitely comes with machine code (otherwise how would your CPU know what to do?)

If you can read machine code, you can grab any program out there and reverse engineer it to figure out what it does, and even modify or patch it!*

Unfortunately machine code is very low-level, so it might take you a while to get used to but it's very normal.
