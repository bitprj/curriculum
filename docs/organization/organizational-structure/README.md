# Organizational Structure

You can see who reports to whom on our organizational chart

## Layers 

| Level | Example | Peer group |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Board | President | @board |
| Director | Director of Marketing | @directors |
| Manager | Engineering Manager | @managers |
| Contributors | Developer | @contributors |

Bit Project has four layers in the organizational structure. When communicating, members can skip layers but cannot  have someone reporting to the same layer since that creates too many layers in the organization. The President is the only person who is part of two levels: the board and the directors.

* **Departments:** lead by Directors and comprise multiple teams
* **Teams:** constitute departments and are made of a  manager and their direct reports.

## Departments

In many ways, we are organized by output. This way we can ensure that responsibilities don't overlap. We also ensure every department has a clear priority.

| Department | Director | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Developer Relations | Kevin Vuong | Create Quality Diverse Educational Content |
| Community Relations | Shreya Gupta | Grow Userbase to Underserved Communities |
| People | Rebecca Tran | Enable people |
| Engineering | Bryan Wong | Execute development |

## Roles

People can be a specialist in one thing and be an expert in multiple things. These are listed on the team page.

#### Specialist

Specialists carry responsibility for a certain topic. They keep track of issues in this topic and/or spend the majority of their time there. Sometimes there is a lead in this topic that they report to. You can be a specialist in only one topic. The specialist description is a paragraph in the job description for a certain title. A specialist is listed after a title, for example: Developer, database specialist \(do not shorten it to Developer, database\). Many specialties represent stable counterparts. For instance, a "Software Engineer in Test, Create" specializes in the "Create" stage group and is dedicated to that group. If you can have multiple ones and/or if you don't spend the majority of your time there it is probably an expertise. Since a specialist has the same job description as others with the title they have the same career path and compensation.

#### Expert

Expert means you have above average experience with a certain topic. Commonly, you're expert in multiple topics after working with Bit project for some time. This helps people in the company to quickly find someone who knows more. Please add these labels to yourself and assign the merge request to your manager. An expertise is not listed in a role description, unlike a specialist.

For Production Engineers, a listing as "Expert" can also mean that the individual is actively embedded with another team. Following the period of being embedded, they are experts in the regular sense of the word described above.

#### Mentor

Whereas an expert might assist you with an individual issue or problem, mentorship is about helping someone grow their career, functional skills, and/or soft skills. It's an investment in someone else's growth.

Some people think of expertise as hard skills \(Ruby, International Employment Law, etc\) rather than soft skills \(managing through conflict, navigating career development in a sales organization, etc\).

If you would like to be a mentor in a certain area, please add the information to the team page. It is important to note whether you would like to be a mentor internally and/or externally at GitLab. Examples of how to specify in the expertise section of the team page: `Mentor - Marketing, Internal to GitLab` or `Mentor - Development (Ruby), External and Internal to GitLab`.
