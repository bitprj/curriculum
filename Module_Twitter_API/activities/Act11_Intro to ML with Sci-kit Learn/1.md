We are going to learn how to use Python's Scikit learn (or Sklearn) library to classify text as either having positive or negative sentiment!

We will use amazon reviews to train our model

Examples

```
Input: "This product was disappointing"

Output: "NEGATIVE"

Input: "I totally loved this chair!"

Output: "POSITIVE"
```

First, go to https://github.com/KeithGalli/sklearn/tree/master/data/sentiment and download the Books_small.json data file that contains JSON data of many amazon reviews.

Let's see what's in this file!

Opening the file we see that each line is the JSON data for one individual Amazon review

![Datafile](C:\Users\orang\Desktop\home\bitlab\machine_learning\Datafile.png)

Each line is a JSON element with many key-values.

We want to extract two things from each review

1. Review (string)                     &rarr; located at key `'reviewText'`
2. Sentiment score (float)      &rarr; located key `'overall'`
   * 1.0-2.0  &rarr; "NEGATIVE"
   * 3.0         &rarr; "NEUTRAL"
   * 4.0-5.0  &rarr; "POSITIVE"



Now, we have the data we can train our model with!

Let's begin coding!

First, we will create a class Review to store these two pieces of data.

```python
class Review:
    def __init__(self, text, score):
        self.text = text
        self.score = score
```

Let's also add a method to get a string of the sentiment called `get_sentiment()`

```python
class Review:
    def __init__(self, text, score):
        self.text = text
        self.score = score
        self.sentiment = self.get_sentiment()
    def get_sentiment(self):
        if self.score <= 2:
            return "NEGATIVE"
        elif self.score == 3:
            return "NEUTRAL"
        else:
            return "POSITIVE"
```

With our Review class defined, we can start populating them with the JSON data from our downloaded file!

We need to extract the sentiment data from each entry in this json data that we just downloaded. We need to import the json library at the top, since we are dealing with json data.

```python
import json
```

To load each review from the data, we first open the file,

```python
file_name = './data/sentiment/books_small.json'

with open(file_name) as f:
```

then we go through each line using a for loop, since each line is a review, and create an instance of our review class. We will store all the instances in a variable called reviews. Remember, the review text is stored in a key called `reviewText` while the rating is stored in a key caleld `overall`.

```python
file_name = './data/sentiment/books_small.json'

reviews = []
with open(file_name) as f:
    for line in f:
        review = json.loads(line)
        reviews.append(Review(review['reviewText'], review['overall']))
```

Nice! We have our data all in one variable `reviews`. Right now, we have strings of data, but we can transform this data into a format that works well with the Sklearn's classifiers!
