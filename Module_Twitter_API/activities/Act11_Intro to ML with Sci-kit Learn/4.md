<!--title={Creating an SVM Classifier}-->

With our transformed data sets, we can create a classifier available in the Sklearn library to predict the sentiment of a given review.

Let's start with SVM, a supervised learning model.

As always, import the library from Sklearn at the top.

```python
from sklearn import svm
```

At the bottom, create an instance of what we just imported

```python
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
```

Train our classifier with our transformed data `train_text_vectors` and the sentiment ratings from the training set `train_sentiment`

```python
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
clf.fit(train_vectors, train_sentiment)
```

Now, we have a classifier, trained and ready to predict!



Let's see if our classifier can fare well again one sample review.

Call the `predict` function of our classifier, pass in "My dog loves this chew bone, it works great!", and print out the return value of this call

```python
review = "My dog loves this chew bone, it works great!""
sentiment_prediction = clf.predict(review)
print(sentiment_prediction)
```

array(['POSITIVE'], dtype='<U8') should print if our classifier is a good predictor, since our review "sounds" positive to our classifier based on the training data we provided
