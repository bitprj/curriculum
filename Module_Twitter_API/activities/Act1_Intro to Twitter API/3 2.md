## New App

Let's head back to the Twitter Developer [menu here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and start exploring.

You should see that you have no apps. Click on 'create an app'.

In the creation of your app, fill out all the required information for your app details. For the website URL field, you can input any website, we used https://bitproject.org. The OAuth Callback URL, TOS and Privacy Policy fields are optional so we will just leave them blank blank.

After creating your app, head to its “Keys and tokens” section, where you will find an API key and API secret key. Copy these keys for later use.
