### Using NLTK

Now that we have a understanding of what NLP is, lets incorporate NLP into python. Before we do that, lets download a library for python. 

It is called NLTK which is a platform that allows us to work with human language. It allows us a variety of tools which will be explored later in the lab. 

You can install NLTK by inserting the line of text into the command prompt. 

```python
pip install nltk

```
