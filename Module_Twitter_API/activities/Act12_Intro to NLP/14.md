## Working with Lemmatization

First, let's import!
	from nltk.stem import wordnet
	from nktk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
	wordLemma = WordNetLemmatizer
	
Then something simple to try it out:
	wordLemma.lemmatize("corpora")
	
Output:
	'corpus'

Yay! It gives the correct origin.

Now, let's also try it with the list of words so do:
	
	for words in word_to_stem:
		print(words + ": " + wordLemma.lemmatize(words))

The output will be 
	give: give
	giving: giving
	given: given
	gave: gave
	
As we can see, lemmatization keeps the words how it is. This is happening because we haven't assigned any POS tagger (part of speech tagger). It determines which word is a noun, verb, etc. We will learn more about it in a few cards.
