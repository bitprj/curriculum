### Components of NLP

You can break NLP down into 2 Components. 

The first: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) 

This part is interpreting the text/language and turning into something useful. This involves mapping input to useful representations, and analyzing different aspects of the language.

The second is Natural Language Generation (NLG). This part deals with generating a response. It takes into account text, words to use, grammer, tone, and putting it all together.

In general NLU is much harder for the machine than NLG. Learning a language is incredibly hard because there is so much ambiguity and how much meaning relies on context. English has so many homophones and NLU has to distinguish between each one. 

The sentence: **She is looking for a match**. It can be interpreted in two different ways. This is a type of *Lexical Ambiguity*. 

Another point of confusion is *Syntactic Ambiguity*. This involves tone and how it effects possible interpretations of the sentence. 

**The chicken is ready to eat**. 

What is being eaten in the sentence? 

The last type of ambiguity I want to address is *Referenctial Ambiguity*. This is confusion through the use of pronouns. **The two boys got into a fight in front of the Teacher. He is very upset**. Which person in the sentence is upset?
