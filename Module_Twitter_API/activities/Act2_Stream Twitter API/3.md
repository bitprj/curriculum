# Twitter API Credentials

Now that you have your Python and Twitter set up, you will now set up a connection between your Twitter API and your Python file. 

To start, you need to log into your Twitter account onto a web browser. Then, go to **apps.twitter.com** to create a new application. Click on the **Create New App** button, which will take you to a form where you will fill out a simple description about the application you are making.

When you finish filling out that form, click on **Create your Twitter application** button and that will take you to the project page for your application.

On that page, click on the **Settings** header and you will find four Twitter user credential codes called "Access Token", "Access Token Secret", "Consumer Key",  and "Consumer Secret".

These four codes are unique to each Twitter account as it links to your Twitter account. You will need these credentials to access the Twitter APIs.

Now that you have found those four access and key codes, create a new Python file in your project directory and open it up. Name that file **twitter_credentials.py** to enter the twitter credentials into this file. It should look like this.

```python
ACCESS_TOKEN = ""        					#ENTER YOUR UNIQUE CODE IN BETWEEN THE QUOTATION
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = ""
CONSUMER_KEY = ""
CONSUMER_SECRET = ""
```

- In the quotations, copy and paste you credentials from the setting page into the corresponding title name on the Python file. This creates variables to contain user credentials to access the Twitter APIs in your project. 

Here is an example of a Comsumer API Key. Yours will look similar in format but unique in key combinations.

When you have done that, you can continue onto the next part of the activity where we will start writing the Python code for the project.
