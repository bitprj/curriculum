We will be writing a program that translates a single word to a new one using a given alphabet.

The original English alphabet is composed of the letter 'a' as the first character, 'b' as the second, 'c' as the third...'z' as the 26th character. This alphabet can be put into a **string** like "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so 'a' is the zeroth index and 'z' is the 25th index.

If we change that string to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", we are essentially translating 'a' to 'A', 'b' to 'B', 'c', to 'C'...'z', to 'Z' (also known as making words uppercase). Using this new alphabet, the word "cat" will become "CAT", since 'c' is replaced by 'C', 'a' is replaced by 'A', and 't' is replaced by 'T'. The new alphabet can be any valid character in Python.

Example output:

```
>>> main()
Please enter 26 characters for your new alphabet
The first character replaces 'a', and the last character replaces 'z'
AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
Enter a word to translate using the new encoding (Enter to exit)
Old Word: outstanding
New Word: OUtStAndInG

Enter a word to translate using the new encoding (Enter to exit)
Old Word: 
>>>
```

```
>>> main()
Please enter 26 characters for your new alphabet
The first character replaces 'a', and the last character replaces 'z'
notenoughcharacters
Not 26 characters
Please enter 26 characters for your new alphabet
The first character replaces 'a', and the last character replaces 'z'

```

For simplicity, the English alphabet used only contains lowercase letters "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", meaning we cannot translate from uppercase letters (although once you finish, you can easily incorporate other symbols too if you correctly modify the program!)
