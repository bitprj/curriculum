## 5-6 Step 1

### name
```
Displaying Remaining Mines
```

### md_content

```
There is an attribute we have already defined that allows us to easily compute the number of mines left on the board.
```

## 5-6 Step 2
### name 
```
Printing out the Columns
```
### md_content
```
Next, in the first row, we should print each column number, those will serve as our column headers and let the player more easily tell what column each cell is in.

Make sure the column number is printed at the beginning and the end of each column for better visibility.
```

## 5-6 Step 3
### name 
```
Printing out the Rows
```
### md_content
```
For each subsequent row, the string representation of each cell should be printed.

* What helper function have we already defined that we can call here to find the value that should be printed for each cell depending on their state?

Make sure the row number is printed at the beginning and the end of each row for better visibility.
```
## 5-6 Step 4
### name 
```
Last Notices
```
### md_content
```
* Make sure you space your numbers and tiles so that the user can easily see for each cell which row and column it belongs to. 
* `__str__` should be returning only **one string**. 
```

## 5-6 Step 5
### name
```
How the board should look like in console
```

### md_content
```
Here is an example of how you should represent your board:
```

### code_snippet
```
Mines: 9
  0123456789
0 XXXXXXXXXX 0
1 XXXXXXXXXX 1
2 XXXXXXXXXX 2
3 XXXXXXXXXX 3
4 XXXXXXXXXX 4
5 XXXXXXXXXX 5
6 XXXXXXXXXX 6
7 XXXXXXXXXX 7
8 XXXXXXXXXX 8
9 XXXXXXXXXX 9
  0123456789
```
