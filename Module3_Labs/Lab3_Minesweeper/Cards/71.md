## Illuminating All Misinput Scenarios

### Step 1: Scenario #1: Input Length

If the user's input is not two or three characters long, it is misinputted. The only exception is when "H" is inputted, and will be an exception for ALL the following scenarios. 

### Step 2: Scenario #2: First Two Characters

The first two characters must each be a digit. 

### Step 3: Scenario #3: Out of Range Integers

If the first two characters are digits then each digit must be within the range of 0 and the board's size. 

### Step 4: Scenario #4: Flagging

When flagging, the first two characters have to be digits and the third character has to be `"f"` exactly.
