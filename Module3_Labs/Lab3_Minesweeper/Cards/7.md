Now that our code allows for the creation of the `Board`, and our `Board` and `Cell` classes are coded out, we can start having the user input moves on the board.

Before making moves on the board, we have to check if the user's move is valid.

The `is_valid` function will do the job! It will take in a string of the user input called `move_input` that represents the user's input and the `board` object and return a Boolean value indicating whether the user's input was valid. 

Players will make a tile visible by inputting the column ID and then the row ID. (example: `20` will make the cell at row 0, column 2 visible.)

### Input Example

Here is an example game: 

![Capture](C:\Users\kevin\Documents\Programming\Darlene\Rewritten\Minesweeper\Minesweeper\Capture.PNG)

The user wants to make the cell at row 5, column 5 visible so "55" is inputted.

A little further down the game, I have made some more moves, and I know a flag is at "36". If I want to place a flag there, it would look like this:

![Capture(3)](C:\Users\kevin\Documents\Programming\Darlene\Rewritten\Minesweeper\Minesweeper\Capture(3).PNG)

In this picture, if the user wants to flag the cell at row x and column y, the user would input "yxf". In this case, the user flags the cell at row 6, column 3 by inputting :36f". Notice the "F" at column 3, row 6. 

Additionally, users are allowed to input `"H"` to get instructions.

What are considered to be invalid inputs for our Minesweeper game? A couple ideas to get you started:

* length of input not 2 or 3
* too many integers
* row and column inputted not valid i.e. outside the size of the board
* wrong placement of "f"
