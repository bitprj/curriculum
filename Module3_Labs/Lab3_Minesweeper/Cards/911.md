## 9-1-1 Step 1
### name
```
Creating your Board
```
### md_content
```
Create your board using `create_board`. Note that if we call `print` directly, the `__str__` method of `Board` automatically gets called!
```
### code_snippet
```python
SIZE = 7
MINES = 9
board = create_board(SIZE, MINES)
print(board)
```
## 9-1-1 Step 2
### name
```
While Checking for Conditions
```
### md_content
```
We know the game is still in session if `board.is_playing` is `True`. We also know the game is solved if `board.is_solved` is `False`, so those are our two conditions to continuously check for. From there we can assign multiple variables returned from `get_move` to get our IDs and `is_flag`.
```
### code_snippet
```python
while board.is_playing and not board.is_solved:
    (row_id, col_id, is_flag) = get_move(board)
```
## 9-1-1 Step 3
### name
```
Determining Whether to Show or Flag
```
### md_content
```
`is_flag` determines whether the move is a flag. If `is_flag` is `False`, then the only other possible move the user can do is `show` a cell. 
```
### code_snippet
```python
    if not is_flag:
        board.show(row_id, col_id)
    else:
        board.flag(row_id, col_id)
    print(board)
```
## 9-1-1 Step 4
### name
```
Handling End Results
```
### md_content
```
If the board is solved, print a congraulatory message. Otherwise the user had to show a mine, indicating a loss.
```
### code_snippet
```
    if board.is_solved:
        print("Well done! You solved the board!")
    else:
        print("Uh oh! You blew up!")
```
## 9-1-1 Step 5
### name
```
`main()` Implementation
```
### code_snippet
```python
def main():
    SIZE = 7
    MINES = 9
    board = create_board(SIZE, MINES)
    print(board)
    while board.is_playing and not board.is_solved:
        (row_id, col_id, is_flag) = get_move(board)
        if not is_flag:
            board.show(row_id, col_id)
        else:
            board.flag(row_id, col_id)
        print(board)

    if board.is_solved:
        print("Well done! You solved the board!")
    else:
        print("Uh oh! You blew up!")
```
