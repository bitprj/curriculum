## `main()` Implemented

### Step 1: Creating your Board

Create your board using `create_board`.

```python
SIZE = 7
MINES = 9
board = create_board(SIZE, MINES)
print(board)
```

Note that if we call `print` directly, the `__str__` method of `Board` automatically gets called!

### Step 2: While Checking for Conditions

We know the game is still in session if `board.is_playing` is `True`. We also know the game is solved if `board.is_solved` is `False`, so those are our two conditions to continuously check for. From there we can assign multiple variables returned from `get_move` to get our IDs and `is_flag`.

```python
while board.is_playing and not board.is_solved:
    (row_id, col_id, is_flag) = get_move(board)
```

### Step 3: Determining Whether to Show or Flag

`is_flag` determines whether the move is a flag. If `is_flag` is `False`, then the only other possible move the user can do is `show` a cell. 

```python
    if not is_flag:
        board.show(row_id, col_id)
    else:
        board.flag(row_id, col_id)
    print(board)
```

### Step 4: Handling End Results

If the board is solved, print a congraulatory message. Otherwise the user had to show a mine, indicating a loss.

```
    if board.is_solved:
        print("Well done! You solved the board!")
    else:
        print("Uh oh! You blew up!")
```

### Step 5: `main()` Implementation

```python
def main():
    SIZE = 7
    MINES = 9
    board = create_board(SIZE, MINES)
    print(board)
    while board.is_playing and not board.is_solved:
        (row_id, col_id, is_flag) = get_move(board)
        if not is_flag:
            board.show(row_id, col_id)
        else:
            board.flag(row_id, col_id)
        print(board)

    if board.is_solved:
        print("Well done! You solved the board!")
    else:
        print("Uh oh! You blew up!")
```
