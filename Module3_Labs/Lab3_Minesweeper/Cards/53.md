## 5-3 Step 1
### name
```
The possibilities to account for
```
### md_content
```
There are four possibilities:

* Visible but a mine -> "M"
* Flagged -> "F"
* Not visible -> "X"
* Visible but not a mine -> number indicating amount of adjacent mines
```
## 5-3 Step 2
### name
```
Handling those possibilities
```
### md_content
```
To handle each of those possibilties, a simple if conditional with the corresponding `Cell` attributes should suffice to handle your "M", "F" and "X" cases.
```
## 5-3 Step 3
### name
```
Handling visible non-mine cells
```
### md_content
```

If a cell is visible and not a mine, we should use our helper `count_surrounding` to calculate the number of surrounding mines. Make sure you handle the case when there are no surrounding mines!
