Now that we have our two classes, `Board` and `Cell`, **let's actually utilize the two classes to create our Minesweeper board!** 

The `create_board` function takes in integers `size` (how big the board should be) and `mines` (the list of numbers of mines we want in our board) and returns a `board` object. 

Within `create_board`, the `board` will be initialized like so:

```python
board = Board(tuple([tuple([Cell(False) for i in range(size)]) for j in range(size)]))
```

Before returning `board`, we want to first put in the mines in randomized cells! For each mine, randomly choose a cell in the board and place the mine in that chosen position.
