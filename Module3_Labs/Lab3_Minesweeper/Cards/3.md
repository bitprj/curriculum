What is the board composed of? Squares or as we will call it in our program, **cells!**

Let's create a **cell** object that we can use for our Minesweeper board! We can do this by building a `Cell` class.

A cell can be **visible**, **flagged**, and/or has a **mine** in it. 

- A visible cell means that it has been selected by the user.
- A flagged cell means that it has been flagged by the user. 
- A cell can also have a mine in it. 

Each of those attributes of the cell has its own **setters**:

- A method that shows what is inside the cell by making the cell visible.
- A method that flags the cell.
- A method that places a mine in the cell.
