Setter Syntax
```
### md_content
```
Each setter takes in a `self` as an argument. `self` refers to a specific instance of our class and under the hood, it ensures that we are calling the method on the correct instance of our class. 

Therefore, whenever we create methods inside our class, we must pass in `self`. 
```
### code_snippet
```python
def setter_name(self):
    # insert your setter implementation here
```
## 3-2-1 Step 2
### name
```
show() Setter
```
### md_content
```
We execute the `show()` setter whenever we want to make a tile **visible**, therefore all we have to do is set the `is_visible` instance variable of `self` to True. 
Note that we don't need a setter for the other way around - if a tile is visible it cannot become invisible!
```
### code_snippet
```python
def show(self):    
    self.is_visible = True
```
## 3-2-1 Step 3
### name
```
flag() Setter
```
### md_content
```
The `flag()` setter is run whenever the user wants to flag/unflag a tile. We just have to invert `self.is_flagged`.
Note that the `not` keyword inverts variables.
```

### code_snippet
```python
def flag(self):
    self.is_flagged = not self.is_flagged
```

## 3-2-1 Step 4
### name
```
place_mine() Setter
```
### md_content
```

The `place_mine()` setter is run to indicate that this tile has a mine. We just have to set `self.is_mine` to `True`:
```
### code_snippet
```python
def place_mine(self):
    self.is_mine = True
```
