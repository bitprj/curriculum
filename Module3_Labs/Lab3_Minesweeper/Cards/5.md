Now that we have completed some helper functions, the `Board` class should contain the following **methods** that will help implement the rules of our Minesweeper game:

- A method `is_solved` that checks if the user has won the game. 
  - should have the `property()` decorator - we will reference `is_solved` as a property of `Cell` later
- A method `flag` that flags/unflags a cell if it has not been selected yet by the user.
- A method `mine_repr` that defines what a cell should reveal, given a cell's row and column. 
  - Should return the cell's value within the board depending on its state
  - "M" for mine, "F" for flagged, and "X" for non-visible cells
  - If a cell is visible and not a mine, then output a number indicating the number of adjacent mines to that cell
    - If number is 0, just output a space
- A method `show()` that handles showing a previously not visible cell. *Hint: there are three different events that will happen whenever a blank cell is selected.* (show())
  - Please make sure to update the `is_playing` property to `False` when a mine is shown - that indicates a loss of the entire game.
  - If a cell is flagged we *do not show it*.
- A method `__str__() ` that prints out the entire board.
  - **This method should return a string that will be printed, not actually print to the console.**
  - Components of the board include the following:
    - The number of mines left in the board
    - The board itself (by default, each cell is an "X")
    - The row numbers on both left and right side of the board
    - The column numbers on both top and bottom side of the board
