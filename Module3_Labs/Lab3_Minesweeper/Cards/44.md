Purpose of `count_surrounding`
```
### md_content
```
Remember that `count_surrounding` returns the number of neighbors of a cell that have a mine. Calling `get_neighbors` will let you obtain a list of neighbors. You'll have to check whether they are valid neighbors with `is_in_range` and if the neighbor is valid, how many of them are mines.
