# Create a new repository

To create a new project on your local machine using git, you need to create a new repository[^1]. We will use the terminal and basic commands for this activity. You should have some experience with basic command lines from the previous activity. If not, refer to the activity *Intro to Command Line* for the usage of command line.

To begin, open up a terminal (the git bash), and move your directory to where you want to place the project on your local machine, using the `cd` command. For convenience in this activity, let's start from your home directory and make a sub-directory called *gitfolder*.

Type `mkdir gitfolder` to create a sub-directory and type `cd gitfolder` to move your present working directory to there.

To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the `git init` command. You will see that the bash changes the appearance of your current working directory to be `(master)`.

This means that your current directory (folder) is initialized as a git repository.
