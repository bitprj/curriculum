# Pull Request

**A pull request (PR)** is a way for us to submit changes to code while promoting open dialogue and review.

A pull request is useful in order to manage changes from contributors.

For example , when a pull request is opened, all the team numbers will get the message. If there are any problems with the changes, teammates can add commits before it merged into the base branch. All the changes done will be automatically stored in the pull request.

Here are the following procedures when making a pull request:

1. We make modifications to our own copy of a git repository.
2. Once we are satisfied, we create a **pull request** to merge your changes into the original repository, with an explanation of what you did and why.
3. A project administrator then reviews our changes and accepts them or initiates discussion on the changes.

On your GitHub page in the *new_repo* repository, click the green button `Compare & pull request` specified for the branch, *new_branch*.

There is a big green button at the bottom, `Merge pull request`. Clicking this means you'll merge your changes into the master branch.
