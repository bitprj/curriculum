# Installing Git

**Installing on Linux**

If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. See [List of Linux distributions – Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) for a list. 

If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use `dnf`:

```console
$ sudo dnf install git-all
```

If you’re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try `apt`:

```console
$ sudo apt install git-all
```



**After Installing**

Once you have done installing Git, create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join). (Accounts are free for public repositories, but may be different for private repositories).

Once you sign up, you can now sign in Github.

## **Configure git to work with GitHub**

Open Git Bash and type the following command line.

`git config --global user.name "Your username of GitHub"`

`git config --global user.email "Your email"`
