GitHub will ask whether you want to create a new repo from scratch or if you want to add a repo you have created locally. In this case, since we have already created a new repo locally, we want to push that onto GitHub so follow the `....or push an existing repository from the command line` section.

The command line is a user interface that is navigated by typing *commands* at prompts.

For Mac users, copy and paste the command line into terminal.

For Windows and Linux users, copy the first command line. Before pasting that into your git bash, right click the navigation bar on your git bash and choose `options...`. Go to `keys` and check the `Ctrl + Shift + letter shortcuts`, and click save.

It will push an existing repository from the command line.

```
# Push an existing repository from the command line
 
git remote add origin https://github.com/c0ldlimit/vimcolors.git
git push -u origin master
```

After doing `git push` your files are know added to remote repo (GitHub repo).
