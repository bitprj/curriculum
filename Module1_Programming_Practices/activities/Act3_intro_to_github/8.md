# Get Changes Back to Computer

Even though the repo on GitHub has the latest version of code, the commit you made in your branch and merged into the master branch doesn't exist in the master branch on your local machine.

First, move your present working branch to the master by running `git checkout master`.

You will see the information of all the files that have changed and how they've changed.
