# Fork a Repository

In GitHub, you can use forking to either **propose changes to someone else's project** or **use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea**.

Forking a repository only takes a simple two-step process. In GitHub, Here is a repository for you to practice with:

1. Go to [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife).

2. In the top-right corner of the page, click `Fork`.

Now, you have a fork of the original octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.

# Sync Your Fork

Although you have a fork of the Spoon-Knife repository, you don't have the files in that repository on your local machine. You can create a *clone* of your fork locally on your computer.

1. On your GitHub account, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.

2. Find the green button called `Clone or download` and click.

3. Copy the URL.

4. Open Git Bash.

5. Enter `git clone` then paste the URL you copied earlier. For example:

   `$ git clone https://github.com/drachenzh/Spoon-Knife.git`.

6. Then, your local clone will be running like this:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/drachenzh/Spoon-Knife.git
   > Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
   > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
   > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
   > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
   > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
   ```

Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.

When you fork a project in order to propose changes to the original repository, you can configure Git to pull changes from the original, or *upstream*, repository into the local clone of your fork.

Since you have cloned the Spoon-Knife repository, you can directly go to Git Bash. Change directories to the location of the fork you cloned before. 

Go to your home directory, find the list of the files and folders in your current directory, go to your cloned Spoon-Knife repository:

```
$ cd 
$ ls
$ cd Spoon-Knife
```

Enter `git remote -v`, and you will see the current configured remote repository for your fork:

```
$ git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
```

Type `git remote add upstream` and then paste the URL that you copied from the Spoon-Knife repository and enter:

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/drachenzh/Spoon-Knife.git
```

To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type `git remote -v` again. You should see the URL for your fork as `origin`, and the URL for the original repository as `upstream`.

```
$ git remote -v
> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

Now, you can keep your fork synced with the upstream repository with a few Git commands.
