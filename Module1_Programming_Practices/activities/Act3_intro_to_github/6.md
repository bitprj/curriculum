# Push a Branch to GitHub

Now, let's **push** the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo, so other people can see the changes you've made.

To push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, run `git push origin new_branch`. GitHub will create the branch for you on the remote repository.

You would see a message similar to this (the data might be slightly different):

```
$ git push origin new_branch

```

(In case you wonder what *origin*[^1] word means in the command above.)

If you refresh your GitHub page, you'll see a note saying that a branch with your name has just been pushed into the repository. You can also click the `branches` link to see your branch listed there.

You're going to click the green button `Compare & pull request` because we're going to make a pull request in our next topic.

[^1]: What happens is that when you clone a remote repository to your local machine, git creates an **alias** for you. In nearly all cases this alias is called "**origin**." It's essentially shorthand for the remote repository's URL.
