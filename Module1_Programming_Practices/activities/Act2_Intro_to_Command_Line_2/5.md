Go to your sub-directory *cpdire* by typing `cd cpdire`, then type `echo "Hello World" > copy.txt` to direct the output "Hello World" to your text file *copy.txt* . This is call *command line redirection* [^1][^2].

If you use the `echo` to redirect output to *copy.txt* again, the command will overwrite the original content. However, you can use `>>` to append the output of the command to a file.

Type `echo "This is an appended line" >> copy.txt` to append the statement "This is an appended line" to the content of *copy.txt*.

If you have the input for a program that reads from standard input stored in a file and don't want to type it, you can feed that file's inputs into the program using `<`.

For example: `some_program < inputFileName`.



[^1]: On a command line, *redirection* is the process of using the input/output of a file or command to use it as an input for another file. It is similar but different from pipes, as It allows reading/ writing from files instead of only commands.
[^2]: Redirection can be done by using the operators `>` and `>>`.
