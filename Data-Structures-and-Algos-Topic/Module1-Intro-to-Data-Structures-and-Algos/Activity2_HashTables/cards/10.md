### Quadratic Probing

Another collision method, similar to linear probing, is **quadratic probing**. Instead of using a constant “skip” value, we use a rehash function that increments the hash value by 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. This means that if the first hash value is *h*, the successive values are ℎ+1, ℎ+4, ℎ+9, ℎ+16, and so on. In other words, quadratic probing uses a skip consisting of successive perfect squares.

Let us assume that the hashed index for an entry is **index** and at **index** there is an occupied slot. The probe sequence will be as follows:

index = index % hashTableSize
index = (index + 12) % hashTableSize
index = (index + 22) % hashTableSize
index = (index + 32) % hashTableSize

and so on...
