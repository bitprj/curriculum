Stack data structure in a wide range of practical applications, they are often able to solve many problems. Next we use the stack to solve an interesting game problem——*Tower of Hanoi*.

### Application Of Stack —— Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three poles and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any poles. The puzzle starts with the disk in a neat stack in ascending order of size in one pole, the smallest at the top thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move all the disks from one pole (say ‘source pole’) to another pole (say ‘destination pole’) with the help of the third pole (say auxiliary pole).

The puzzle has the following  **two rules** :

1. You can’t place a larger disk onto smaller disk
2. Only one disk can be moved at a time

With our stack implementation, we can go ahead and solve the Tower of Hanoi. Each pole (tower) will be represented by a stack and each disk will be represented as a data element that is stored in the stack. 

**Assumption :**

3 disks and 3 poles(towers).  Below is a visual representation:

> Note: the left, middle and right poles correspond respectively to the source, auxililary and destination.

Our objective is to get the stack of disks you see above in the source pole over to the destination pole in the exact same order without stacking a larger disk onto a smaller disk. The reason why implementing a stack would solve this problem because this would help rearrange the size of the disks depending on what was inserted the latest in the pole and can be rearranged for the other poles.
