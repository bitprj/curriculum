To put it in the simplest terms, one can think of a linked list like a string of pearls. Each pearl in the string leads to the next. The first pearl on the string can be called the "head" pearl. In a linked list, the "head" node, as can be assumed, is the very first node in the list. Each node contains two things: some data associated with the node, and a reference to the next node in the list. 

In a singly linked list, each node (or pearl) has one single reference to the next node (or pearl) in the list. A doubly linked list instead has two references, one for the next node, and one for the previous node. The last node in all linked lists points to a "null" node, signifying the end of the list.

Many benefits come with using a linked list instead of any other similar data structure (like a static array). This includes dynamic memory allocation--if one doesn't know the amount of data they want to store during initialization, a linked list can help with quickly adjusting the size of the list.

However, there are also several disadvantages to using a linked list. More space is used when dynamically allocating memory (mostly for the reference to the next node), and if you want to access an item in the middle, you have to start at the "head" node and follow the references until reaching the item wanted.

**In practice, some insertions cost more. If the list initially allocates enough space for six nodes, inserting a seventh means the list has to double its space (up to 12).**

### The Linked List

A simple implementation of a linked list includes the following methods:

- Node class: implementing the idea of a Node and its attributes
- Insert: inserts a new node into the list
- Size: returns size of list
- Search: searches list for a node containing the requested data and returns that node if found, otherwise raises an error
- Delete: searches list for a node containing the requested data and removes it from list if found, otherwise raises an error

Now, we can create the start of our linked list! Luckily, the linked list (as a class) itself is actually the "head" node of the list!

**Note: Upon initialization, a list has no nodes, so the "head" node is set to None. Because a linked list doesn't necessarily need a node to initialized, the "head" node will, by default, set itself to None.**

```python
class LinkedList(object):
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head
```
Now we can implement the most important attribute of a linked list: the node!
