Now that we understand the basic structure of a **Binary Search Tree**, let's start to build up some useful functions that will allow us to access and manipulate our trees.

#### BST Search:

If you know the key to a specific node in a BST and want to access it within your BST, how would you do this? Let's build a function called `BSTSearch` that will allow us to do this.

```Python
def BSTSearch(curNode, key):
    if curNode is None or curNode.key == key:
        return curNode
    if curNode.key < key:
        return BSTSearch(curNode.right, key) #Go right
    else:
        return search(curNode.left, key) #Go left
```

The `BSTSearch` function behaves similarly to how you would if you were looking for a specific key in a BST: go right if you're looking for a larger key or go left if you're looking for a smaller key. It starts at the root and calls the same function again on its right child if the desired key is greater than the current node's key or calls the same function again on its left child if the desired key is less than the current node's key. It eventually returns the current node being inspected if the node's key matches the desired key or returns `None` if it doesn't find a node with a desired key.

Let's actually see this in action using the tree from the previous card as as an example. Let's say we want to find `7` in our tree. Below, you can see the specific path that `BSTSearch` takes to look for the node:

##### Time Complexity:

Since we're interested in finding the asymptotic time in the **worst-case**, we must consider what the worst case situation would be when searching for a node.

The diagram above depicts the worst-case scenario when searching for the node with key 50. As you can see, the time to reach a desired node would be O(height), and in this worst-case scenario, it would be **O(n)**, with **n** being the amount of nodes in the tree, since you have to search through every node in the tree.

`BSTSearch` **= O(n)**



###### How was this worst case made? (under time complexity)

If you want to access a node with value of 50, you need to go from the root and move to the right child and treat the child as a new node. You need to do it for 5 times. The time complexity is O(n).
