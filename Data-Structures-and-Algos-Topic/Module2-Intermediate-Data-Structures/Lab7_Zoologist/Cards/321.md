```python
j = i-1
```

`j` represents all the elements preceding `i`, one by one, meaning we will have to keep decrementing `j` until it hits 0. `key` will be our respective element (or the element we are comparing all `j` elements to).

We do this in a **while-loop** and only for elements larger than our respective element `key`.

To shift the element, we assign the element at `j` to `j + 1`.

```python
while j >= 0 and key < arr[j] : 
    arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
    j -= 1
```

After all this shifting is done, we shift the final element, our respective element, forward.

```python
arr[j + 1] = key
print(arr)
```

Now, all the intermittent shifting is done and the iteration is over. That is why we print out `arr` after these lines.
