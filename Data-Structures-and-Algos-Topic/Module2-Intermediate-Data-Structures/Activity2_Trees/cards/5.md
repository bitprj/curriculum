Another very useful function when working with BSTs is the ability to add nodes to the tree.

#### BST Insert:

When adding a new node to a BST, we must find the correct place to insert that node. Let's look at the code for `BSTInsert`:

```Python
def BSTInsert(curNode, newNode):
    if curNode is None:
        curNode = newNode
    else:
        if curNode.key < newNode.val:
            if curNode.right is None:
                curNode.right = newNode
            else:
                BSTInsert(curNode.right, newNode)
        else:
            if curNode.left is None:
                curNode.left = newNode
            else:
                BSTInsert(curNode.left, newNode)
```

`BSTInsert` traverses through the BST in a similar way to `BSTSearch`. However, once it finds that the specific child is `None` in the place where the new node belongs, it places that node there. Try working and experimenting with the code on your own machine.

To illustrate how this code works, let's use a simple tree as an example. We will add a node with key `11` to this tree. Below, you can see the specific path that `BSTInsert` takes to insert the node as well as the actual position that `11` ends up in:

##### Time Complexity:

Similar to `BSTSearch`, the worst-case scenario runtime for `BSTInsert` is also **O(n)**. The worst-case scenario would occur when you must go through every node in the tree to find the proper place to insert the node.

Let's use the same example from the previous card to illustrate this:

<img src="../images/5-2.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

In order to insert `60` into this tree, we needed to visit every other node first. Hence, this was a worst-case scenario.

###### How was this worst case made? (under time complexity)

if you need to insert a node with value of 60, you need to find the place first, which you need to visit five node. In this example, you need to go from 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. You construct right child of node with value of 50. Thus, the time complexity will be O(n).
