## Bubble Sort Implementation in Python

```python
def bubbleSort(bubble):
   for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):

```

Let's start with writing a function. We want to first identify the length of our list for when we start comparing elements. In the beginning, the length will simply be the original size of the list, but with every iteration, it will grow smaller. This is because as we fully sort more numbers, we reduce the number of elements to compare and swap the next time.

```python
	for i in range(n):
           if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
```

Here, we look at and compare two elements in our range. If the current element is smaller than the next one, they need to be swapped. Again, we are trying to sort an array of numbers from smallest to largest. 

```python
			   temp = bubble[i]
               bubble[i] = bubble[i+1]
               bubble[i+1] = temp
```

This is a classic swap procedure that switches two elements in a list. We first make a temporary copy of the current element and store its value. Then, we set the value of the current element to the next element's value. Finally, we set the next element's value to the current element's *original* value from our copy.

We will continue comparing and swapping every pair of numbers until the entire list is sorted from smallest to largest. 

```python
def bubbleSort(bubble):
   for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
    for i in range(n):
       if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
           temp = bubble[i]
           bubble[i] = bubble[i+1]
           bubble[i+1] = temp
	
bubble = [14,46,43,27,57,41,45,21,70]
bubbleSort(bubble)
print(bubble)
```

To test if our sort function works, we can create a sample list and run our function.
