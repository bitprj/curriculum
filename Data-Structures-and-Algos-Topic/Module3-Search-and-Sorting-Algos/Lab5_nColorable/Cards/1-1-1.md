### Step 1: DFS  and Backtracking Search

In the algorithm, we can use **DFS** to inspect all of the nodes in our graph and assign a color to each node. In order to speed up the process, we can use **Backtracking Search**. Backtracking search will keep track of which colors are valid for a specific vertex and will ensure that the color assigned to the current vertex being inspected has not been assigned to a vertex that is connected to the current vertex. If no possible color can be assigned to a vertex, the backtracking search will indicate this to be the case and the program will acknowledge that the graph is not n-Colorable.
