# Steps

## 4-2-1 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Call nx.draw() to draw the roots connecting each node for the graph**
```

### md_content

```
In order to tell the `matplotlib` library what the graph will look like, we need to call the `nx.draw()` function. Here, we provide the graph (`G2`), the positioning (`pos`), and we let the function know we don't want the labels it'd assign by setting `with_labels` to `False` (i.e we want to tell it what the labels should be).
```

### code_snippet

```python
    nx.draw(G2, pos = pos, with_labels = False) 
```
## 4-2-1 Step 2

### name

```
**Step 2: Call draw_networkx_labels() to label each node**
```

### md_content

```
Now, we want to let `matplotlib` know what the labels of each node should be. To do this, we use the `draw_networkx_labels()` function from `networkx`. Again, we provide `G2` and `pos`,  but now we also give the labels mapped to each node (`val_map`) and specify the font size of the labeling to `8`.
```

### code_snippet

```python
    nx.draw_networkx_labels(G2, pos, val_map, 8)
```
## 4-2-1 Step 3

### name

```
**Step 3: Call plt.show() to show the final visual for our graph**
```

### md_content

```
Lastly, in order to actually see the graph, we use the `matplotlib` function `show()`.  Here, since we already told `matplotlib` what to show, we just have to call the function:
```

### code_snippet

```python
    plt.show()
```

### md_content

```
Now, if you run the code, you should be able to see the graph visually with the proper structure and labels!
