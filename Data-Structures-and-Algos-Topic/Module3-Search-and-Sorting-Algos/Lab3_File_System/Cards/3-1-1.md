# Steps

## 3-1-1 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Understand DFS**
```

### md_content

```
`DFS` is an algorithm which traverses a graph (directed or undirected) through the use of a `stack`. We start with a given start node (in this case, the root), mark it as "visited,"" and push unvisited neighbors to the `stack`. We then pop the top node off of the `stack`, mark it as "visited," and repeat this process until all nodes have been visited. 

Hopefully, that rings a bell. It's important to have a fundamental understanding of `DFS` to complete this part of the lab. If needed, you can refer back to the activities which discuss `DFS` in depth (no pun intended!).

Let's get to the specifics of this problem now. We begin with the first 4 steps of the initial setup of the DFS algorithm for this problem.
```

## 3-1-1 Step 2

### name

```
**Step 2: Create visited defaultdict(bool)**
```

### md_content

```
You need to create a `visited` `defaultdict(bool)`. We have to use a `defaultdict` to index our `visited` by the string that identifies a given node (i.e `"011"`). 
```

### code_snippet

```python
        visited = defaultdict(bool)
```

## 3-1-1 Step 3

### name

```
**Step 3: Creating the `stack`**
```

### md_content

```
A `stack` must be created since it will hold the nodes we need to visit next. Here, it will enable us to print out our "folders" in the correct relative order: 
```

### code_snippet

```python
		stack = []
```

### md_content

```
Why does a `stack` work for this? Well, it's because this problem wants us to order the folders such that we go as "far" down the hierarchy as possible **before** going back up (once we can't go any further down). That is, we wish to print `0` , then its first child `01` , then its children `011`, `012`, `013` **before** we print `0`'s second child, `02` (refer to diagram below).  
```

### md_content

```
Notice how we are going as far down the tree as possible by popping from the **top** of `stack`. The `stack` allows us to do this as we can add all the unprinted, neighboring folders of the one we just printed, pop the **top** of the `stack` and print that folder, and repeat this process until all the folders are printed.

Now, back to the code.    
```

## 3-1-1 Step 4

### name

```
**Step 4: Push values into `stack` using `start` to represent the first item**
```

### md_content

```
Since we want to start with `start`, we need to push it onto our `stack`.
```

### code_snippet

```python
		stack.append(start)
```

## 3-1-1 Step 5

### name

```
**Step 5: Signify that each item added into the `stack` is in the `stack` (i.e. mark it as `True`)**
```

### md_content

```
Since we are pushing `start` onto our `stack`, that means we already visited it, so we need to mark it as such:
```

### code_snippet

```python
		visited[start] = True
```

### md_content

```
Given that our start node has been pushed on the `stack` and marked as "visited," it is time to start the DFS traversal. Try to think about how you can implement DFS in the context of this lab.
