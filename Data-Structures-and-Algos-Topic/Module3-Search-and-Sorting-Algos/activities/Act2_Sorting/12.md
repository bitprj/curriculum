# Quicksort Theory

Quick sort may be the hardest of the 4 to understand as it relies on something called a "pivot value"  to compare and swap numbers around.

We will use a sample list to demonstrate each step of the algorithm. This is the same list that we saw in our Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort examples:

1. We first choose an element to be our "pivot point".  There are many different strategies on how to pick the pivot point. For our example, we will choose a random element, `3` as our pivot. The code below chooses to always pick the last element in a list as the pivot.

2. Start at the left of the list and continue through until you come across a value higher than that of the pivot. In our case, we didn't need to move. The first element `6` is already larger than our pivot.

3. Do the same starting from the right end of the list. Move left until you come across a value smaller than that the pivot. That would be the `2` in our example, the second-to-last element in the list.

4. Swap these two values.

5. Continue moving in through the list, repeating steps 2-4 until both sides meet the pivot point. At this point, our list should look like this:

6. We're done with `3`. Now we select a different pivot and repeat the process all over again. We keep doing this until we get a fully sorted list, as shown below:
