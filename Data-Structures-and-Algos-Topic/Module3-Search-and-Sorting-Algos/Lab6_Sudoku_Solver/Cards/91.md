# main() Part 2

Here are some specific hints about implementing main() part 2:

* Our timer should start at 0.
* You should output the user options (described earlier) to the screen and wait for the user's response before taking any action.
* There should be a few conditionals (if, elif, else) for handling each type of input. Specifically, here are some functions you should invoke in developing the algorithm for each option.
  * p: `printGrid()`
  * c: `complete()`
  * `(r, c)`: `findPossible()`
  * `enter`: `nextMove()`
* The function `hasMoves()` will play a large role in determining when we should stop asking for input. When `hasMoves()` is false, the grid is complete, and we need to compute the elapsed time.
