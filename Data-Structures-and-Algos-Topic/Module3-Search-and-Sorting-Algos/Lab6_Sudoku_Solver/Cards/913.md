# main() Part 2

In the else statement from when we've confirmed that the `grid` is complete, we need to stop our timer and compute the elapsed time. Also, we will print our now complete `grid`:

```python
	else:
		time2 = time.time()
		printGrid(grid)
		if time1 != 0:
			print("Solved in %0.2fs!" % (time2-time1))
		else:
			print("Solved!")
```

Step 1: Assign `time2` to `time.time()`. 

This will give us the current time when we have reached inside this else statement. 

Step 2: Check that `time1 != 0` to confirm that a time was recorded for `time1`. 

Once this is done, we can compute the time spent to complete the Sudoku board with the computation `time2 - time1`. 

Step 3: Call `printGrid(grid)` to print our final grid.

Now, we have finally finished our Sudoku Solver! This is how our logic will appear for user input options during the process of solving their valid Sudoku board:

```python
time1 = 0

c = input("Controls:\n\t'Enter': Display the next move\n\t'p': Print the current grid (small)\n\t'c': Complete the grid (or attempt to)\n\t'(r,c)': Prints the possible options for that row, column\n")
while hasMoves(grid) and (len(c) == 0 or c == "p" or c == "c" or c[0] == "("):
	if c == "p":
		printGrid(grid)
	elif c == "c":
		time1 = time.time()
		if not complete(grid):
			print("Failed to complete.  Please improve algorithm. :)")
			#break
	elif len(c) > 0 and c[0] == "(":
		print(findPossible(int(c[1])-1,int(c[3])-1,grid))
	else:
		nextMove(grid)

	if hasMoves(grid):
		c = input("Controls:\n\t'Enter': Display the next move\n\t'p': Print the current grid (small)\n\t'c': Complete the grid (or attempt to)\n\t'(r,c)': Prints the possible options for that row, column\n")
	else:
		time2 = time.time()
		printGrid(grid)
		if time1 != 0:
			print("Solved in %0.2fs!" % (time2-time1))
		else:
			print("Solved!")
```

That's it! We are done! Congratulations on completing the Sudoku Solver Lab!
