# steps

## 4-2-1 Step 1

### name

```
Call nx.draw() to draw the roots that will connect each node for the graph
```

### md_content

```
In order to tell the `matplotlib` library what the graph is going to look like, we need to call the `nx.draw()` function.  Here, we provide the graph (`G2`), the positioning (`pos`), and we let the function know that we don't want the labels it would assign by setting `with_labels` to `False` (i.e we want to tell it what the labels should be).
```

### code_snippet

```python
    nx.draw(G2, pos = pos, with_labels = False) 
```
## 4-2-1 Step 2

### name

```
Call draw_networkx_labels() to label each node
```

### md_content

```
Now, we want to let `matplotlib` know what the labels of each node should be. To do this, we use the `draw_networkx_labels()` function from `networkx`. Again, we provide `G2` and `pos`,  but now we also give the labels that are mapped to each node (`val_map`) and specify the font size of the labeling to `8`.
```

### code_snippet

```python
    nx.draw_networkx_labels(G2, pos, val_map, 8)
```
## 4-2-1 Step 3

### name

```
Call plt.show() to show the final visual for our graph
```

### md_content

```
Lastly, in order to actually see the graph, we use the `matplotlib` function `show()`. Here, since we have already told `matplotlib` what we want to show, we just have to call the function.

Now, if you run the code, you should be able to see the graph visually with the proper structure and labels!
```

### code_snippet

```python
    plt.show()
```
