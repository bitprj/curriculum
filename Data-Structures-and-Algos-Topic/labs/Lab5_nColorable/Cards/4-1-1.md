You'll be giving the `checkVertex()` function the adjacency matrix graph, current index of the node you're inspecting, the colors vector, the color you want to assign to the current index, and the number of vertices. 

**Step 1:  check if the connected vertex has the color that we want to give to the current vertex**

We will look at all the entries in the current index's row in the adjacency matrix and look for a 1. If we see a 1, that means that the current index's vertex is connected to another vertex, so we check if that connected vertex has the color assignment that we want to give to the current vertex. If we get through the entire current index's row without satisfying both of these conditions, it is safe to assign the color to the current vertex and we return True. The code is much more concise than the explanation. Let's check it out:

```Python
def checkVertex(graph, curIndex, colors, color, numVertices):
    for i in range(0,numVertices):
        if graph[curIndex][i] == 1 and colors[i] == color:
            return False
        
   	return True
```
