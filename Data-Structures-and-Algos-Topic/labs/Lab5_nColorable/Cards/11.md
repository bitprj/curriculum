This lab will require you to use **Depth First Search** and **Backtracking Search** to solve the n-Colorable problem. Therefore, we will briefly review both of these concepts.

#### Step 1: Depth First Search (DFS)

In **DFS** or **depth first search**, we start at a root node in our graph (this can be *the* root node, but also the root of any subtree), and traverse down a single branch to find our target node. If we don't find it, we traverse down the other branch. If we still don't find it, we pick one of the root's children to be the new root node and start over. We can perform our search in different orders just as with traversal, namely **preorder**, **inorder**, or **postorder**.

How do you think we can use **DFS** in our solution to the n-Colorable problem?

#### Step2: Backtracking Search

With **backtracking search**, we solve the problem recursively. However, when a solution does not satisfy the conditions of our problem, we remove it from consideration.  In other words, we try every possible attempt at finding a solution and discard all failures until we arrive at a viable answer.

Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by attempting to build a solution incrementally, removing failures to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time.



How do you think we can apply this logic of **backtracking search** into our n-Colorable solution to quicken the assignment of colors to vertices?

In this example, we first try left tree A. For node A, we have two options, C and D. Both of them are bad; root A does not satisfy the solution, so we discard this solution. Root B is the counterpart of root A, so we then try node B. We also have two choices, node E and node F. Node E is good, so we find one solution, while node F is bad, which we will discard.
