## 5-1-1 Step 1

### name

`main()`
```
### md_content
```
The `main()` function is responsible for calling all the appropriate functions and getting user input. Here is a proper implementation of the `main()` function:
```
### code_snippet
```Python
def main():
    # Call fileReader() function to get 2D list graph
    graph = fileReader("test.csv")
    
    # Get numVertices by getting length of graph
    numVertices = len(graph)
    
    # Get user input for n
    n = int(input("Enter n: "))
    
    # Call initColors() to initialize colors list
    colors = initColors(numVertices)
    
    #Call the graphColoring() function and if it returns false, that means that the graph can't be colored
    if graphColoring(graph, n colors, 0, numVertices) == False:
        print("Graph cannot be colored")
    else:
        print("The color assignments are: ")
        for color in colors:
            print(color)
```

### md_content
```
Note that your `main()` function may not look exactly like this. That is okay. Just make sure that your code has all the desired functionality for the program to work correctly. Also note that the file with the adjacency matrix provided by the user is called `test.csv` in this case.
