# isValid() Function

Starting off with the function definition accepting the `grid` as an argument, we will have:

```python
def isValid(grid)
```
Step 1: Write two nested for-loops to check rows and columns for repeats.

As we discussed earlier, since we need to check if there are no repeats in any rows or columns within `grid`, we will need two nested for-loops: one to check that all rows contain no repeats and another to check that all columns contain no repeats. We return `True` if no repeats are found.

```python
def isValid(grid)
  for row in grid:
    for i in row:
      # implement logic here to check for repeats in all rows
      
  for c in range(0,9):
    for r in range (0,9):
      # implement logic here to check for repeats in all columns
      
  return True
```



For the first nested for-loop, the outer loop iterates through each `row` in `grid`.

```python
for row in grid:
```

Then, the inner loop iterates through each element `i`  in  `row`:

```python
for i in row:
```

This is because each of the nine lists inside of `grid` represents each `row`, thus, you can simply iterate through the elements in a `row` to make comparisons for checking repeated values.


Notice that for the second nested for-loop, we are iterating through  `range(0,9)`, which loops from 0 to 9 in both inner and outer loops. This is because we must iterate through each `row` at the same index in order to compare elements within the same column, as our `grid` is a list of rows.

```python
for c in range(0,9):
   for r in range (0,9):
```

For example, if we check all the values for the first column (`c == 0`), we will iterate through the rows (`r`) from `0-9`.

Here's a sample representation of how the rows and columns are within a 3x3 2-D list similar to `grid`:

Step 2: Create an empty list to store values read in a row.


For our first nested for-loop, we will define an empty list called `found` within the outer-loop:

```python
	# Check that all rows contain no repeats
  for row in grid:
		found = []
		for i in row:
```

As we iterate through the elements within a row, we will store the elements into `found` to determine if any of the remaining elements in that row exist in `found` already, indicating that there is a repeated value in that row. 

```python
	# Check that all rows contain no repeats
	for row in grid:
		found = []
		for i in row:
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)
```

Within the inner loop, we check if `i`, the current element in `row`, exists inside of `found`. If `i` is indeed inside of `found`, then we return False to indicate that there was a repeated value in the row. Otherwise, we append element `i` into `found` if `i != 0` (because we do not want to append empty spaces).



Step 3: Create a list to store values read from a column.


Moving on to check the next nested for-loop for repeated values in columns, we will initialize an empty list `found` for the same reason as implemented above.

```python
	# Check that all columns contain no repeats
  for c in range(0,9):
		found = []
		for r in range(0,9):
```

Then, we will use `i` to assign to `grid[r][c]`to iterate through all values within each column to check for repeats. If `i` (the value within a particular column `c`) is not in `found` and does not equal to 0 (a empty space), then we will append the value to `found`.

```python
	# Check that all columns contain no repeats
	for c in range(0,9):
		found = []
		for r in range(0,9):
			i = grid[r][c]
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)

	return True
```

At last, we have our final function `isValid()`:

```python
def isValid(grid):
	# Check that all rows contain no repeats
	for row in grid:
		found = []
		for i in row:
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)

	# Check that all columns contain no repeats
	for c in range(0,9):
		found = []
		for r in range(0,9):
			i = grid[r][c]
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)

	return True
```
