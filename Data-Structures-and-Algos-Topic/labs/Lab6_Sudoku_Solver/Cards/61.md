# complete()

`hasMoves()` is a simple function that will basically return a boolean (True or False) by determining if there are any 0's in `grid`. This indicates whether or not the Sudoku board has any remaining moves or if it's done. Thus, we can accomplish this in one line:

```python
# This checks if the grid is finished
def hasMoves(grid):
	return any(0 in row for row in grid)
```

If there are any 0's in a `row` for all the rows in `grid`, then return True. Otherwise return False, which indicates that the `grid` is complete.


Since our `complete()` function is continually calling `nextMove()` until it gets stuck or succeeds, we should check if our `grid` still has moves. Hence, we will keep this logic in a while loop:

```python
def complete(grid,depth=0):
    moved = True
  	while hasMoves(grid) and moved:
      # Implement logic here to determine the state of moved
```

`moved` will be a boolean initialized to True and will only be set False once a move has not been found...
