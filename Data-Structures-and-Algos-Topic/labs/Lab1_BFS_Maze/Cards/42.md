**Step 1: Find the First Path and Storing Coordinates**

The BFS algorithm must begin with the start coordinates given.

Additionally, one of data structures will store a growing list of paths to be taken. During each iteration, you will remove the first path from the list and store its last coordinates. You will need the last coordinate to know if you've reached the end coordinate or to grow your path by analyzing its neighbors.

Store the first path, find its last coordinate, and store that last coordinate for further querying.
