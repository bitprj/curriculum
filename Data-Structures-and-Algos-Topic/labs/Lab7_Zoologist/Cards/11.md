`Animals.txt` is a **file** that contains an `int` followed by a `string`. To read this content in a `dictionary`, you should use `open()` and `for` loops to **split** each line of content in the text file into a **dictionary**. The integer should be the **key** and the animal should be the **value**.

Animals.txt file:

```python
1	Horse
2	Buffalo
3	Cat
4	Rabbit
5	Goat
6	Dog
7	Sheep
8	Pig
9	Cow
10	Human
11	Rat
12	Mice
13	Bat
14	Squirrel
15	Turtle
```

Example of **dictionary**:

```python
5: Himalayan wolf
```
