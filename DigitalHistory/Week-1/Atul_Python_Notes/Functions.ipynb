Functions will be one of our main building blocks when we construct larger and larger amounts of code to solve problems.\n","\n","**So what is a function?**\n","\n","Formally, a function is a useful device that groups together a set of statements so they can be run more than once. They can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.\n","\n","On a more fundamental level, functions allow us to not have to repeatedly write the same code again and again. If you remember back to the lessons on strings and lists, remember that we used a function len() to get the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.\n","\n","Functions will be one of most basic levels of reusing code in Python, and it will also allow us to start thinking of program design."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-ghJ1ZQJNWcZ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## def Statements\n","\n","Let's see how to build out a function's syntax in Python.

These arguments are the inputs for your function. You'll be able to use these inputs in your function and reference them.

Lots of other programing languages do not do this, so keep that in mind.\n","\n","Next you'll see the docstring, this is where you write a basic description of the function. Docstrings are not necessary for simple functions, but it's good practice to put them in so you or other people can easily understand the code you write.\n","\n","After all this you begin writing the code you wish to execute.\n","\n","The best way to learn functions is by going through examples.
