Insertion sort uproots the current element of a list, compares it to all previous elements that we have already looked it, and places it in the appropriate spot. Because of this, insertion sort only needs one pass to fully sort a list.

Let's use an example list to illustrate the specific steps of the algorithm:

1. We first take the second element and compare it to the first. If it is smaller, we place it before the first element. We are trying to sort the array from smallest to largest. After this initial step, our sample list will look like this:

2. Move onto the next element, in this case 3. Since this is the third element, we compare it to the previous *two* elements. 3 is smaller than both 5 and 6, so it will be placed in the first position of our list. Our list now looks like this:

3. We continue down the list and keep repeating this process, comparing the nth element with the n - 1  previous elements, and adjusting its position until we get a fully sorted array as shown below:

   ### Insertion Sort In Python

   ```python
   def insertionSort(arr): 
       for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
           key = arr[i] 
           j = i-1
           
   ```

   First we create a function. We use a for loop to make a pass through our list and compare elements. We call the element we are currently looking at as `key`. The variable `j` is the name for a previous element we are comparing to `key`.  We start at the second element of our list,  `i = 1`.

```python
    		while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]: 
                   arr[j+1] = arr[j] 
                   j -= 1
```

Here, we shift any elements of our list that are bigger than `key` one position to the right, while making sure we don't go out of bounds on our indices.

   ```python
	arr[j + 1] = key
   ```

When we finish shifting elements, and our function breaks out of the while loop, we need to make sure the element we were looking at (`key`) is in its proper place. We place it in the appropriate position in our list. Now, we can then start looking at the next element which becomes our new `key`. 

   ```python
def insertionSort(arr): 
    for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
        key = arr[i] 
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
        	arr[j+1] = arr[j]
        	j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6] 
insertionSort(arr) 
print(arr) 
   ```

   Use this block of code to test if our function is working properly.
