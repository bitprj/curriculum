# Insertion Sort Theory

Insertion sort uproots the current element of a list, compares it to all previous elements that we have already looked it, and places it in the appropriate spot. Because of this, insertion sort only needs one pass to fully sort a list.

Let's use an example list to illustrate the specific steps of the algorithm:

1. We first take the second element and compare it to the first. If it is smaller, we place it before the first element. We are trying to sort the array from smallest to largest. After this initial step, our sample list will look like this:

2. Move onto the next element, in this case 3. Since this is the third element, we compare it to the previous *two* elements. 3 is smaller than both 5 and 6, so it will be placed in the first position of our list. Our list now looks like this:

3. We continue down the list and keep repeating this process, comparing the nth element with the n - 1  previous elements, and adjusting its position until we get a fully sorted array as shown below:
