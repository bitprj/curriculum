### Merge Sort in Python (Part I)

```python
def mergeSort(alist):
    if len(alist) > 1:
        mid = len(alist) // 2 # integer division
```

Let's start off with creating a function. If the length of the list we are looking at is greater than 1, we know it might need sorting. We first create a variable called `mid` which finds the middle position of the list. We need this to be able to do the initial splitting of the list into two equal groups. 

```python
		lefthalf = alist[:mid]
        righthalf = alist[mid:]
```

These two lines split the list into two equal groups, if possible. `lefthalf` holds all the elements of our original list from the beginning up to (*but not including*) `mid`. `righthalf` then holds all of the elements from  the `mid`, or middle, position all the way to the end.

```
		mergeSort(lefthalf)
        mergeSort(righthalf)
```

Here we use recursion to split up the two halves of our list. We simply treat each part as another list and put it through the same splitting process we just went through. We keep doing this until we get to the place where we have each element on its own and ready to be placed into pairs. The code for actually sorting the elements and combining them into groups comes next.
