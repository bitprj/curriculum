Bubble Sort is considered to be one of the simplest sorting algorithms. The name comes from the fact that this method compares two adjacent elements and swaps them if they're not in order. This makes larger values "bubble to the top" (to the very end of the list), giving us a fully sorted list in the end.

Lets break up this process into its logical steps, using the list shown above:

1. Compare the first two numbers, if they are not sorted (the larger number comes before the smaller number), then swap the two. This assumes that you want the list elements to be sorted from smallest to largest. In our list, 6 comes before 5, so we swap the two. The list now looks like this:

2. Move on from the first and compare the second and third values, swap if necessary. In our case, 6 now comes before 3 so we swap again:

3. Continue down the list until reaching the last element. At this point the largest value has been sorted. In our example, 8 is the largest number. So at this point, 8 should now be at the very last position of the list:

4. We finished the first pass of the list. Now, we start over again from the first number, 5 in our case, and repeat steps 1-3. This time, however, we continue down the list to the *second-to-last* element. This is because we can see that 8 is in the position it should be. It doesn't need to be swapped anymore. We then repeat the whole process until we arrive at the fully sorted list that we want:

## Bubble Sort in Python

```python
def bubbleSort(bubble):
   for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):

```

Let's start with writing a function. We want to first identify the length of our list for when we start comparing elements. In the beginning, the length will simply be the original size of the list, but with every iteration this length will grow smaller. This is because as we fully sort more and more numbers, we reduce the number of elements we need to compare and swap the next time.

```python
	for i in range(n):
           if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
```

Here, we look at and compare two elements in our range. If the current element is smaller than the element next to it, they need to be swapped. Again, we are trying to sort an array of numbers from smallest to largest. 

```python
			   temp = bubble[i]
               bubble[i] = bubble[i+1]
               bubble[i+1] = temp
```

This is a classic swap procedure that switches two elements in a list. We first make a temporary copy of the current element and store its value. Then, we set the value of the current element to the next element's value. Finally, we set the next element's value to the current element's *original* value, which we still have from our copy.

We will continue comparing and swapping every pair of numbers until the entire list is sorted from smallest to largest. 

```python
def bubbleSort(bubble):
   for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
    for i in range(n):
           if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
               temp = bubble[i]
               bubble[i] = bubble[i+1]
               bubble[i+1] = temp
	
bubble = [14,46,43,27,57,41,45,21,70]
bubbleSort(bubble)
print(bubble)
```

To test if our sort function works, we can create a sample list and run our function.
