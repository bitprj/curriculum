### Insertion Sort Implementation In Python

   ```python
   def insertionSort(arr): 
       for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
          key = arr[i] 
          j = i-1
           
   ```

   First we create a function. We use a for loop to make a pass through our list and compare elements. We call the element we are currently looking at as `key`. The variable `j` is the name for a previous element we are comparing to `key`.  We start at the second element of our list,  `i = 1`.

```python
    		while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]: 
                arr[j+1] = arr[j] 
                j -= 1
```

Here, we shift any elements of our list that are bigger than `key` one position to the right, while making sure we don't go out of bounds on our indices.

   ```python
	arr[j + 1] = key
   ```

When we finish shifting elements, and our function breaks out of the while loop, we need to make sure the element we were looking at (`key`) is in its proper place. We place it in the appropriate position in our list. Now, we can then start looking at the next element which becomes our new `key`. 

   ```python
def insertionSort(arr): 
    for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
        key = arr[i] 
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
        	arr[j+1] = arr[j]
        	j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
            
# Driver code            
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6] 
insertionSort(arr) 
print(arr) 
   ```

   Use this block of code to test if our function is working properly.
