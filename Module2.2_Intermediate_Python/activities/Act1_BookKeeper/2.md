We need to obtain the numbers from the data file "deweyNums.txt" first.

First, open "deweyNums.txt" for reading using `with` ... `as`.

```python
with open("deweyNums.txt") as file:
```

Each number is on its own line in the file, so we can read the entire file as one **string** using `read()` with no arguments (the default reads the entire file as one **string**), then use `.split("\n")` to partition each element of the string between the **newlines** as its own element in the file

```python
fileData = file.read().split("\n")
```

Before we return this result, there may be an empty string as the last element, so we can try to remove this for safe measures using the list function `remove("")`.

```python
fileData.remove("")
return fileData
```
