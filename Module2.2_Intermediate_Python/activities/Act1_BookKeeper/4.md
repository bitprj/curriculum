*Resolving Issue: Testing*

We need to print the distributions of each genre now.

We have all the data we need:

* `genreData`, which holds the count of each genre if we index by a genre class and the genre to Dewey number + call number assignment.

* `count`, which holds how many numbers were read from the file `deweyNums.txt`

* `genreClasses`, which hold the names of each genre class for printing.

We need to iterate through each genre class and print out their distributions. Let's use a **for loop**:

```python
for genreClass in genreClasses:
```

To calculate the distribution of `genreClass`, we need to divide the count for that genre by the total count of all numbers. Then we multiply by 100, since it's a percentage.

We can get the count for that genre using `genreData`

```python
distr = genreData[genreClass] / count * 100
```

We can print this distribution out to two decimal places using `format()`. It is also a **float**, so we need to add a following 'f'.

```python
print(genreClass + ": " + "{:.2f}".format(distr) + "%")
```
