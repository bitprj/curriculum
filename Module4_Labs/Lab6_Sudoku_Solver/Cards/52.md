# nextMove()

Now onto our second clause where we will check by number. This segment of our function will be broken down into three parts where we will evaluate by column, row, and box. For each of the possible numbers in Sudoku, we will loop through values 0 to 9 and checking to see if that value is possible (by using `findPossible()`  to check) as we check by row, column and box. So first we will need to check that `foundMove` is `False`, and if so we iterate through the possible values as such:

```python
	# Check by number
	if not foundMove:
		for n in range(1,10):
```



Now here are some hints for our 3 conditions within this clause:

- 1) Check by row: 

  - This will consist of a nested for-loop iterating through rows to check if any empty square can possibly be replaced with one value, from 0 to 9.

  - If so then you will store the row-column pair of that square and assign it the current number.

  - The basic structure for this check will look like below: 

    - ```python
      if not foundMove:
         				for r_i in range(0,9):
         					m = []
         					for c_i in range(0,9):
               # Implement checking logic here for each row
      ```

      > Note: if the current number `n` exists within the list returned from `findPossible() `, then we will append the row, column pair (`r_i`, `c_i`) into the initially empty list `m`.

- 2) Check by column: 

  - This will consist of a nested for-loop iterating through columns to check if any empty square can possibly be replaced with one value, from 0 to 9. 

  - If so then you will store the row-column pair of that square and assign it the current number.

  - The basic structure for this check will look like below:

    - ```python
      if not foundMove:
         				for c_i in range(0,9):
         					m = []
         					for r_i in range(0,9):
               # Implement checking logic here for each column
      ```

      > Note: if the current number `n` exists within the list returned from `findPossible() `, then we will append the row, column pair (`r_i`, `c_i`) into the initially empty list `m`.

- 3) Check by box: 

  - This will consist of two nested for-loops: 

    - The first nested for-loop to iterate through all the squares within a single box to discover if the current number is a possible value that does not yet exist within the box (via `box()`).
    - If the current number is one possible value (from 0 to 9), within the square for that box, the second nested for-loop will iterate through all the squares within that same box and use `findPossible()` to determine if the current number is still a valid possibility to fill in the empty square.

  - The basic structure for this check will look like below:

    - ```python
      # Check by box
         			if not foundMove:
         				for b_r in range(0,3):
         					for b_c in range(0,3):
               # Implement logic here to check for `n` inside a box
              	if n in b:
         							m = []
         							for r in range(b_r*3,b_r*3+3):
         								for c in range(b_c*3,b_c*3+3):
                     # Implement logic here to to check if 'n' is 
                     # valid at the particular square 
      ```

      > Note: if the current number `n` exists inside the box `b` returned from `box()`, the next nested for-loop will check if `n` exists within the list returned from `findPossible() `, then we will append the row, column pair (`r_i`, `c_i`) into the initially empty list `m`.





Up to now, the structure of our function will now look like this:

```python
def nextMove(grid,silent=False,depth=0,finish=False):
	foundMove = False
	# Easy iteration through all spots, checking if clearly only one
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9): #a nested for-loop that iterates through all possible square 
			possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
			if len(possible) == 1:
				if not foundMove:
					if not silent:
						print("(" + str(r_i+1) + "," + str(c_i+1) + ") -> " + str(possible[0]) + "  [Only possible]")
					grid[r_i][c_i] = possible[0]
					foundMove = True

	# Check by number
	if not foundMove:
		for n in range(1,10):
			# Check by row
			if not foundMove:
				for r_i in range(0,9):
					m = []
					for c_i in range(0,9):

			# Check by column
			if not foundMove:
				for c_i in range(0,9):
					m = []
					for r_i in range(0,9):
            
			# Check by box
			if not foundMove:
				for b_r in range(0,3):
					for b_c in range(0,3):
            #
						if n in b:
							m = []
							for r in range(b_r*3,b_r*3+3):
								for c in range(b_c*3,b_c*3+3):
```
