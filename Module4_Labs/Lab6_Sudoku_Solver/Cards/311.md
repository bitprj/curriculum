# Working Within a Box

With our nested for-loop mechanism to iterate through all the elements inside a specified box, we just need to append all non-zero elements into `elems`. So we will first use a variable `e` which we will denote as the current element we are indexed at in a box:

```python
e = grid[r][c]
```



Given `e`, the current element in our nested for-loop, we will now check if it is non-zero and exists inside of `elems`. If both cases are true, then we will remove the value, denoted by `e`, from `elems`.

```python
if e != 0 and e in elems:
  elems.remove(e)
```



At last, we just return `elems` after iterating through our entire nested for-loop and `box()` is done!

```python
# This returns all elements in a given box
def box(grid,r_i,c_i):
	elems = list(range(1,10))
	for r in range(r_i*3,r_i*3+3):
		for c in range(c_i*3,c_i*3+3):
			e = grid[r][c]
			if e != 0 and e in elems:
				elems.remove(e)
	return elems
```
