# Introduction of invalid function

for this card, we'll introduce some ideas about the invalid grid. For Sudoku Solver game, we need no duplicate on each row, column and box. For example, if 1 exist on the first row twice, we call it invalid. 

## isValid()

Write the `isValid()` function- which will be used to check if the user's inputted Sudoku board is valid by verifying there are no duplicate values in any rows and columns. The function will take in one argument which will be the user's initial Sudoku board that we will define as `grid`. Remember that `grid` is a 2-D list that contains 9 lists with 9 elements in each list.

Here is an example of a valid grid that would return True from `isValid()`:

```python
                            9 4 _ | _ 2 _ | 7 _ _		
                            _ _ 1 | _ _ 4 | _ _ 9		
                            _ _ 6 | _ _ _ | 1 2 _	
                            ------|-------|-------
                            _ _ _ | _ _ 3 | _ 1 _
                            1 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ 8
                            _ 7 _ | 5 _ _ | _ _ _
                            ------|-------|-------
                            _ 8 7 | _ _ _ | 2 _ _
                            6 _ _ | 9 _ _ | 3 _ _
                            _ _ 9 | _ 8 _ | _ 5 7
```



Here is an example of an invalid grid that would return False from `isValid()`:

```python
                            3 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _		
                            6 _ _ | 1 _ _ | _ _ 4		 
                            _ 9 _ | _ 3 3 | 2 5 _		
                            ------|-------|-------	
                            _ 9 _ | 2 _ _ | _ _ _		
                            1 _ _ | _ _ 6 | 3 _ _
                            _ 7 _ | _ _ _ | _ 1 _
                            ------|-------|-------
                            _ 1 2 | _ 8 7 | _ _ _
                            4 _ _ | 6 _ _ | 9 _ _
                            _ _ _ | _ 9 _ | _ 8 _
```

> 3's in the same row at [2, 4] and [2, 5] and 9's in same column at [2, 1] and [3, 1].
