You are a zoologist who returned to your lab only to find that your documents have been messed with and scrambled! You had tediously studied, determined and **sorted** different species of animals by their population growth rate from <u>lowest to highest</u>.

The next course of action to undo this mess will be to pair each population growth equation with the species it's associated with. Then sort these pairs. However, your supervisor is meticulous in what method they want you to use. Therefore, they have asked you to show each step of sorting.

You only need to sort the list of species in **descending** order of their population growth using three different sorting techniques (as per lab policy D).

Data you were able to procure from the mess:

* Numbers representing specific growth rate for each species

Your job:

1. Pair each growth rate with each animal

2. Rank the growth rates in descending order

3. Sort the ranks using **Bubble sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Selection Sort**

After step 3, you will have sorted rankings, so you know the correct order of the growth rates, and you will have the pairings of each animal to their growth rate. Knowing these two facts, you will have reobtained your sorted population growth list.



Let's do step 1.

First, create a **function** named `readFileintoDict()` that will ask for user input about a file's names, `Animals.txt`, then open that file and read its contents into a **dictionary** with keys as an index of the animal and the values as the animal name. Each index is associated with a growth rate in the file. This function should also **return** the said dictionary. 

Go ahead and code `readFileintoDict()`using the `Animals.txt` file:

```python
1	Horse
2	Buffalo
3	Cat
4	Rabbit
5	Goat
6	Dog
7	Sheep
8	Pig
9	Cow
10	Human
11	Rat
12	Mice
13	Bat
14	Squirrel
15	Turtle
```
