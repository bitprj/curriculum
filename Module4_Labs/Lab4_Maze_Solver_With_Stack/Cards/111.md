Define `__init__` as the following:

```python
self.index = -1
self.arr = [None] * ROWS * COLUMNS
```

Here we are creating a 2D array that is 30 by 100 which is the size of the maze map

Note : ROWS and COLUMNS are defined as global variables.

```python
ROWS = 30
COLUMNS = 100
```

Define `push` as the following

```python
self.index = self.index +1
self.arr[self.index] = a
```
