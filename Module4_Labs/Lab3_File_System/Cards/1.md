We will be representing a simple file structure with a directed graph. You will receive a text file on which to base it off of. The file will contain a bunch of file and folder names written in the format: `###. some words`. Each node that you will input within the graph, will always have some relation to the original parent node to represent the common connnection that each node shares. The following is an example of a file you could receive.

```
0. Friends
01. Season 1
011. Stranger Things
012. Gotham
013. Prison Break
02. Season 2
021. MADMAX
022. Trick or Treat
...
```

- the numbers representing the "level" of the folder/file. `0` being the root folder and `01` being a subfolder of `0`, so on and so forth. 
- In the example above, `0. Friends` would be the root, while `01. Season 1` would be its subfolder. We can see here that with `0` being   the initial folder of our file, we can see that each subfolder has some relationship with the original folder. In this case, we can     see here that `0` is the root folder for the show `Friends`. 
- Based off of this, the `01. Season 1` would be the subfolder that would recommend shows that are similar in viewership and content in   relation to `0. Friends`; hence explaining roots `011 to 013` being connected to `0. Friends`. 
- Same could be said for the `02. Season 2` subfolder containg shows that are similar to `0. Friends` 2nd season. This example will
  create a form of a recommendation system in which they would recommend seasons of shows that are very similar to the season's of the     root folder in the file.
  - you can assume that the level or the number of folders/files per level will never surpass `9`
  - you can assume that the root will always be `0`
- `some words` represents the "name" of the folder/file, similar to how you would name your folders

In the first part of the program, you will be required to:

* Parse the file to obtain the structural numbers, *and* the names of the folders/files 

In later stages of the lab, you will:

* Find a way to represent these components in a directed graph
* Display the graph using `networkx` and redirect the output to a file 


This lab serves to illustrate, from start to finish, a practical application of directed graphs. Upon completing this lab, you should learn about the sorts of situations in which one would ideally choose a directed graph as their data structure implementation.
