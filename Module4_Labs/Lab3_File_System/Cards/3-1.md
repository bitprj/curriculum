# steps

## 3-1 Step 1

### name

```
Step 1: Check if you have visited a previous node
```

### md_content

```
First, you need to think about how you will keep track of "where you have been" when traversing. Try to think about how using a `defaultdict(bool)` will enable you to see if you have already been to a given node. 
```

## 3-1 Step 2

### name

```
Step 2: Make sure that you start on the initial root
```

### md_content

```
Once you have those set up, you need to make sure that your DFS traversal starts at (and, therefore, marks as visited) the root, `start`.
```
