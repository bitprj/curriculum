In order to make sure that your `Graph` implementation is held correctly, you will need to write the structure to another file, similar to the file that you were given originally. 

Basically, you need to have a full understanding of how the graph is held in order to complete this part of the lab. 

For instance, given the below file,

```
0. Some Show
01. Season 1
011. The Vanishing of Will Byers
012. The Weirdo on Maple Street
013. Holly, Jolly
014. The Body
015. The Flea and the Acrobat
016. The Monster
017. The Bathtub
018. The The Upside Down
02. Season 2
021. MADMAX
022. Trick or Treat
...
```

your `print_ordered_file_structure()` (which will be a function/method of your `Graph` class) should write the following to an output file:

```
0. Some Show
01. Season 1
011. The Vanishing of Will Byers
012. The Weirdo on Maple Street
013. Holly, Jolly
014. The Body
015. The Flea and the Acrobat
016. The Monster
017. The Bathtub
018. The The Upside Down
02. Season 2
021. MADMAX
022. Trick or Treat
...
```

In order to achieve this, you're going to want to implement a `DFS` style traversal, using a `stack`.

Lastly, as mentioned earlier, instead of printing out this information, you're going to want to write it to an output file, which should be named `output.txt`.
