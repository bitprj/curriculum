In the previous easy card, we added initializing an **attribute** called `val_map` in the constructor. This attribute is of a type dictionary because it can be easily be represented as a **key-value** pair, with the key as the node and the value as the name of the folder or file.

In the previous step, when reading the file, we had already stored the nodes and their corresponding values as a dictionary, so it would be easy to add it to the graph that way.

We write a method that accepts a dictionary as a parameter to store each **key-value** pair for our node:

```python
def add_val_map(self, val_map):
	self.val_map = val_map
```

Once we have created this method, we would create a graph and then add this **key-value** pair into our graph:

```python
G2.add_val_map(val_map)
```
