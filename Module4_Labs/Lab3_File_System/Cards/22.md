In addition to storing the edges, our graph class should also store the values of the nodes (the names of the folders/files).  This would greatly help as we are printing out the graph. Because it is important information about the graph, we want to store them as an attribute of our graph class.

You will need to use a dictonary (call it `val_map`) to store the node's information.
