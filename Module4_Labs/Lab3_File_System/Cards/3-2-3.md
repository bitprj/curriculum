## 3-2-3 Step 1

### name

```
Call print_ordered_file_structure() to write output
```

### md_content

```
We want to finally call `print_ordered_file_structure()` in `main()` in order to write our output to the output file. 

We call it on `G` since that is the graph we constructed manually, and we provide the argument `"0"`, since that will signify our *root* of the graph.

We have now completed the main portion of the file system lab!
```

### code_snippet

```python
 G.print_ordered_file_structure("0")
```
