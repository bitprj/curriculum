**Step 3: Draw the graph**

Now that you have `G, val_map, and pos`. You have all the things you need to draw the graph!

Recall how you can use the `draw()` function from the `networkx` library to actually depict the graph. How do you call it ? 

Once you have achieved this, you will have a pictorial representation of the file system! However, you are still going to be missing the important things: the labels!

Try to remember how to use the `draw_networkx_labels()` function to achieve this! 

Lastly, in order to actually see the graph on your screen, you need to use the `matplolib` function that **shows** the graph.
