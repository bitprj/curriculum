Python has many packages which allow you to do a variety of complex functions. One of these is the `networkx` package, which we will use to visually see a graph. However, we won't be able to use this package with our custom class `Graph` and, instead, will have to use the built-in `networkx` functions to construct another graph. The importing of the libraries and construction of the graph using `networkx` is done in the Starter Code. See https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/tutorial.html for more details on graphs and the `networkx` package.

While we will be using the graph `G2 = nx.Graph()` to initialize our graph for use with the `networkx` functions, we can   still add the `edges` and `val_map` values we parsed from the input file into `G2`. Explore the `networkx` package to see which functions you could do to achieve this! 

Additionally, you need to make sure that the graph prints in a "tree" orientation. By default, the graph will not be shown as we want it to appear. We would like it to appear as a hierarchal, "tree-like" graph, which is oriented like such:

From the above diagram, you can see that a "tree-like" graph is one in which there are no cycles and there is a parent-child relationship between nodes; that is, there is an edge between the parent and child nodes. Not every node needs children, but every child node (except the root), will have an associated parent node.

In order to achieve this "tree" orientation, you must set the positioning, `pos`,  of the graph's nodes by using the `hierarchy_pos()` function we have provided. `pos` refers to the position of each node and the reason why this function is important is because we can find the precise location to input each node in our graph. Basically, the `hierarchy_pos()` function manually alters the nodes positions, `pos`,  in order to have them oriented in the above manner. This needs to be done manually because `networkx`  currently does not have a predefined layout option to represent a graph in a hierarchal manner. Since that is the case, we would call the `hierarchy_pos()` function to ensure that each node's position is situated properly to print the same result that we see in our connected graph.

Once this is achieved, you will need to use one of the `networkx`  functions that allow you to **draw** the graph, and another to draw the graph with **labels** (hint: `val_map` stores your labels) so that each node will hold it's file name. Then, to actually see the graph, you will need to use the `matplotlib` function to **show** the graph. `matplotlib` is Python's visual library that creates graphs of mathematical models. The reason why we would use this library is because `networkx` isn't capable of producing the visual for the graph on its own.
