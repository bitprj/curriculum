# steps

## 4-1-1 Step 1

### name

```
Use the `add_edges_from()` function
```

### md_content

```
Use the `add_edges_from()` function from the `networkx` package to add edges to `G2`. We had saved these edges in a list in previous parts of the lab and should reuse that variable.
```

### code_snippet

```python
G2.add_edges_from(edges)
```

## 4-1-1 Step 2

### name

```
Use the hieracrhy_pos() function to order the positioning of each node
```

### md_content

```
Since `hierarchy_pos()` is a function designed to make the graph's layout hierarchical, we should call it, passing in our graph `G2` and our root, which is always `"0"`. Since `hierarchy_pos()` returns a position, we save the return value into a variable `pos`.
```

### code_snippet

```python
pos = hierarchy_pos(G2,"0") 
```
