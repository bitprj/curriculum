# steps

## 1-2-2 Step 1

### name

```
Store the edges of the directed graph
```

### md_content

```
Now that we have isolated the folder numbers, we will have to figure out how to organize our edges, maintaining our numbering hierarchy.

To find and store the edges for later use, we can slice the structural number string to everything but the last character. Notice how this new sliced string is the structural number string of the parent of the current folder. We are going to represent each individual edge as a tuple, and all the edges as a list. Here, we make one edge, store it as a tuple, and add it to the list.

The first parameter of `aTuple` is the structural number of the parent of the current folder and the second parameter is the structural number of the current folder itself. `aTuple` represents an edge from parent to child. 
```

### code_snippet

```python
	aTuple = (dirAndVal[0][:-1], dirAndVal[0])
	edges.append(aTuple)
```



## 1-2-2 Step 2

### name

```
Handle edge cases
```

### md_content

```
Remember to check to check your **edge cases**!

Why is the above good for handling an edge case? What is that edge case? I'll give you a hint: its purpose lies in the code given here. 

Here, we are forming a tuple whose first element represents a parent and whose second element represents a child of the parent. We do this by separating the last number in the structural number from the rest of the structural number in order to clearly see the parent number. For example, the following shows how to store the edge from the parent of `dirAndVal[0] = 0123` to `0123` itself.

* `dirAndVal[0][:-1]` would return `012`, the parent structural number
* `dirAndVal[0]` would return `0123`, the child structural number

`aTuple` would then be `(012, 0123)`.

Now, once again, let's return to why our edge case check is necessary. If we are processing the root (represented by `0`)

* `dirAndVal[0][:-1]` would return nothing
* `dirAndVal[0]` would return `0`

Our `aTuple` would be confusing, as the first element would be empty! Thus, since the root is a special exception (it has no parent), we do not want to create an `aTuple` where `0` is the child (second parameter of `aTuple`) structural number.
```

### code_snippet

```python
if (dirAndVal[0] != "0"):
	aTuple = (dirAndVal[0][:-1], dirAndVal[0])
```
