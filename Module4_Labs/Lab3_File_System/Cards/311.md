**Indentify the root for the graph**

As explained earlier,  we need to take this extra step because the `networkx` library does not have a preset layout that will represent the graph as a tree. 

Luckily, we provided you with a manual implementation of this layout in the `hierarchy_pos()` functions. 

Here we are calling `hierarchy_pos()` with our graph, `G`, as an argument, as well as the string `"0"`. We do this because we want to tell the function that it will be dealing with the layout of our graph `G`; and the `"0"` tells the graph that for our graph, `"0" ` is the identity of the root node.

```python
    pos = hierarchy_pos(G,"0")
```
