**Step 1: initializing data structures code**

Here is the entire BFS pseudocode for your reference: (this will be available on every Easy card)

```pseudocode
initialize a queue Q with start # this section covers this line
initialize a set V tracking visited spaces # this section covers this line

  while Q is not empty:
    path = Q.pop()
    last = last node in path

    if last == end
      return path
    else if last is not in V
      for all spaces adjacent to last but not in V do
        newPath = array(path)
        newPath.append(adjacentSpace)
        add newPath to the queue
      V.add(last)
    return null
```

We use a queue to keep track of the paths that will be searched. This queue is always initialized with just the start coordinates as our starting point.  

Then we use a set to keep track of the coordinates that have already been visited - if a set of coordinates has already been visited, we've already looked at their neighbors, there's no need to go back to them! We also use a set because we don't care about the order of the visited coordinates.

## Code in Python

```python
queue = [start]
visited = set()
```
