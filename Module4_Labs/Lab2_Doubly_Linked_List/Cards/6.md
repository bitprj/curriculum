Similar to insertion, there are also multiple ways to delete elements from a doubly linked list, and they are the same as introduced in the previous card. Check out the description and implement these functions in your doubly linked list class.

---

**Step 11: popFront()**

**Deleting Elements From the Start**

- Define a function called **popFront()** which does not take in any parameter.
- If the list is empty, return.
- Otherwise, delete the head node.

**Step 12: popBack()**

**Deleting Elements From the End**

- Define a function called **popBack()** which also take in no parameter.
- If the list is empty, return.
- Otherwise, delete the tail node.

**Step 13: pop()**

**Deleting Elements by Value**

Write a function called **pop()**. In this method, you need to think carefully since several cases have to be handled in order to remove an element by value.

- This function takes in a value as the parameter.
- If the list is empty, return.
- If the targeted node is not in the list, print the message: "Target not found".
- Otherwise, remove the node that contains the element in the list.
