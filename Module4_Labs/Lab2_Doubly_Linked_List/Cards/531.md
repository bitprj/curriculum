**Step 6: insertAfter(target, newData)**

We learned how to insert at the front and back of the list, but what about the middle? Or in between the 3rd and 4th node?

This next function, `insertAfter(target, newData)` will allow us to do just that. If we wanted to insert a new node between the 3rd and 4th node, we would call `insertAfter(3rd node, newData)` since we want the previous of the new node to be the 3rd node.

```python
def insertAfter(self, target, newData):
  
		# 1. If the list is empty
  	if self.head == None:
        return
    
    else:
    		curr = self.head

    		# 2. Search for target node
    		while curr.data != target:
      			curr = curr.next
            
            if curr == None:
            		print("Target not found.")
                return

    		# 3. If target was found, curr != None
        newNode = Node(newData)
        newNode.prev = curr
        newNode.next = curr.next

        # 4. If curr is not the last node
        if curr.next is not None:
          	curr.next.prev = newNode

        else:
            self.tail = newNode
            
         # 5. Connect the current node with the new node
         curr.next = newNode

    # Increment size
    self.size += 1
```

For `insertAfter(target, newData)`, we will (1) check if the list is empty, (2) then search for the `target` node and have a pointer to it named `curr` for current node. If `curr` is equal to `None`,  that means we were not able to find the target in the list. If `target` was found, (3) initialize a `newNode` with the `newData` and establish connections for `next` and `prev`. (4) Now check if it's not the last node in the list. We do this because if we are at last node in the list, `newNode.next` will already point to `None`. If we are at the last node, we will also set the new node as `self.tail`. Finally, we (5) make the current node's `next` point to the new node.
