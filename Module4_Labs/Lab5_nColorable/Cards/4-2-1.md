### Step 1:  `graphColoring()` 

Here is the Python implementation of the `graphColoring()` function:

```Python
def graphColoring(graph, n, colors, curIndex, numVertices):
    #Base Case: return True once at last row of graph
    if curIndex == numVertices:
        return True
    
    # for loop that goes from 1 to n. Which is one loop per color in colors
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        #Call checkVertex on the currentColor to see if the current vertex can have that color
        if checkVertex(graph, curIndex, colors, i, numVertices) == True:
            # If previous condition holds, assign color i to the current vertex
            colors[curIndex] = i
            # Now that we've assigned the color i to current vertex, recursively call graphColoring() on the next vertex
            if graphColoring(graph, n, colors, curIndex + 1, numVertices) == True:
                return True
            colors[curIndex] = 0
     #Returns false if no color can be assigned to a specific vertex. This is part of backtracking search
     return False
```



Note the recursive usage of **DFS** and **backtracking search** being implemented by returning `False` if no color can be assigned to a vertex.
