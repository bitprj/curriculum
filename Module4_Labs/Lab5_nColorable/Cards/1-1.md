This lab will require you to use **Depth First Search** and **Backtracking Search** to solve the n-Colorable problem. Therefore, I will give you some explanation on both of these concepts.

#### Step 1: Depth First Search (DFS)

In **DFS** on graphs, we keep delving into the tree by calling the function on the vertices that are connected to the current vertex. We stop recursively calling once we get to a vertex that has no connected vertices that haven't been called yet, and we inspect that vertex. The reason it's called **depth** first search, is because we go through the graph and inspect the nodes further down the graph first. 

How do you think we can use **DFS** in our solution to the n-Colorable problem?

#### Step2: Backtracking Search

With **backtracking search**, we solve the problem recursively, but when a solution does not satisfy the conditions of our problem, we remove it from consideration at that point in time. 

How do you think we can apply this logic of **backtracking search** into our solution to the n-Colorable problem to quicken our process of assigning colors to vertices?
