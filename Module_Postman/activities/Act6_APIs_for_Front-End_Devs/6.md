Just like before, we would need to look at the menu bar on side and see if there is a folder there that would give us a clue about the request we would need to use. Fortunately, there is a folder named "Asteroids Near Earth Objects" at the very top. Inside that folder, There are now three possible API Requests:

Unlike before we now have to choose between the three HTTP requests that we can use. However, before we do that, it is important to check to see if the request that we need is actually in one of these three. To do so, we should first read the overall description for this group.

From this description, appears that one of the three requests will give us the data that we want. Now, our next step would be to read the description of each request individually.

Once all three have been read, the one that should stand out the most is the Feed GET request. The first request also does the job; however, the main problem with it is that it gives too much data and does not give the user the ability to filter. This information is apparent from the documentation. This Feed request, on the other hand, lets us choose two dates for its parameters that will filter the data for us:

Another difference that we will see in this request is that we can see a window on the right that provides an example of what this request call will send back.

By clicking this window, it will expand and show you everything that this request will have to offer in its response. However, it is still important to test and experiment with this HTTP request as you will see in the next card.
