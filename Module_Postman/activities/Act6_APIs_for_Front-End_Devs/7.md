Now, as before, we must locate the **Feed** request in Postman. Then, we are going to want to input the missing values in our parameters.

What we should get is a large JSON object as a response. However, what we are going to do differently from before is that we are going to mess around with the parameters to get a better grasp of what our API can and cannot do. Thus, for our first experiment, we will want to change the **end_date** to 2019-08-29 to see if an error will occur.

Surprisingly enough, It still works and provides data! Now, we know that the end date and start date does not matter for this specific request. Now, what if the **end_date** is moved ahead to 2021? Once the request has been sent, we should get this response:

From this experiment, we know that this request does not care if the end date is before the start date, but it does care about the difference in days between the two.  This experiment has shown that although documentation is very useful and important, it is not perfect. It will not state *everything* about what it is documenting about, and some functions or small intricacies can ***only*** be found through experimenting with the subject in question such as now.
