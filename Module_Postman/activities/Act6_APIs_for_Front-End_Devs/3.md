<!--title={Finding our first API call}-->

The first thing to do when you open up documentation is to find the documentation for the particular requests you are going to use. Since we are using Postman's documentation, we can easily locate the requests by using the menu panel on th left side of your screen. The menu panel neatly groups together API requests, making it easier to locate your desired HTTP requests.

Locate the folder titled **Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)**. This folder contains one of the API requests that you will be using for your website, the **Today** GET request. After clicking on the folder, let's focus on two aspects of the documentation:

1) The explanation/description for the request

2) The Parameters and Headers for the request

These two are important as the first gives you a brief overview of what the request provides you, while the second tells you how to use the request.

For this documentation, there are two descriptions for the HTTP requests. The first gives a summary of what **all** the requests in the folder do, while the second description is more specific to that individual request. The parameters and headers, on the other hand, are below the second description for the request.

The Parameters and Headers section of every API Documentation tells you the necessary data you would need to send along with the request in order to get the desired response. After reading the description and knowing the parameters and headers for this specific request, we can now test our API call in Postman.
