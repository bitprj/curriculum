<!--title={Running Data Files}-->

How does Postman read the data file? 

Remember in the beginning when we changed the URL from a number to a variable name? 

Instead of:

```
{{url}}delete/#
```

We changed it to:

```
{{url}}delete/{{box_id}}
```

Notice that in both our JSON file and CSV file, there is a "box_id" title. 

In our CSV file, the first line is "box_id". In order for our Postman Runner to read which variable to change, the first line has to be names of all the variables you want to change. 

Lets say we want to be able to put different colors onto our table using one datafile.

The first thing we would need to do is edit our command line. From

```
{{url}}change/#/color
```

to

````
{{url}}change/{{box_id}}/{{color}}
````

Now in our datafile, we would add another column with the command header. 

Here is another example CSV file. 

```
box_id, color
1, blue
2, green
3, blue
4, green
5, blue
... 
```

The output can look something like this

Feel free to play around with the datafiles and see how you can use them to your advantage. They are incredibly powerful and allow us to perform many more operations.
