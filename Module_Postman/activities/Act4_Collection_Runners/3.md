<!--title={Collection Runner Part 3}-->

Postman Collection Runner allows us to upload a datafile that it will read from and cycle through. In other words, if we upload a datafile containing all the box numbers, Postman will send a unique request for each box number. This will allows us to clear our board efficiently. 

For our datafile, we have the option of using either a .csv or .json file. 

The format for our `.csv` should look like so:

with the numbers continuing up to 400. 

If we were to use a `.json` file, the format would look like so

The text from the .csv file is available for you to copy and paste so you don't have to write it out yourself. 

Now that we provided a file for postman to read from, lets discuss how postman actually read this file to know what to run.
