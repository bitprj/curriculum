# POST Request

Now that we are finished with GET request, let's take a look at POST request.

While GET request is for retrieving information, for example, we retrieve the information about box with our GET request POST request is for inserting information.

In this example, we will be coloring white boxes with our POST request.

According to [the documentation]( https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4691925/SW15zHJv?version=latest#a633bb6c-c481-497e-8696-72129056398e), the route for changing the color of a box is `https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/change/<int:box_id>/<string:color>`.

So go ahead and replace `https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/` with our environment variable, `url`, replace `<int:box_id>` with the box ID that you want to modify, and replace `<string:color>` with the color you want to change your box into.

Don't forget to set the Authorization setting! Otherwise, you are be good to go!

Go ahead and send a request, and watch the box change color!
