Now, fill out the route for this GET request like the following: `{{url}}boxes/<int:box_id>`

Since we have 400 boxes, we can replace `<int:box_id>` with any number from 1- 400.

Recall that our`url` has the value, `https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/`, therefore, in actuality, the request route that we are sending is : `https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/boxes/24`.
