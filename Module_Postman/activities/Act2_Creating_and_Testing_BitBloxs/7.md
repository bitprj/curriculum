# API Authentication

Now if you attempt to send out the request, you will receive an error message:

```json
{
    "message": "You are not authenticated, you need an API Key to use this route"
}
```

This is because we still need an API key to access the API. 

Go to the `Authorization` tab and select the authorization `type` as `API Key`. Then, set the value for `Key`, `Value`, `Add to` as the following. Again, we are using the environment variable that we set up earlier for our purpose.

Now that our request has all the information that we need! We shall be able to retrieve the value of any box of your choice!
