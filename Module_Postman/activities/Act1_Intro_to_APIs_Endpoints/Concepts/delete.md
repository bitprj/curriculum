# DELETE Request

A DELETE request is used to remove a specific object that already exists in the database. You would usually use this request when you no longer need a specific instance of an object in your database.

Lets say that we no longer need the movie Thor in our database. In order to get rid of the movie, we would send a DELETE request to delete Thor. After that request, Thor will no longer exist in our database.
