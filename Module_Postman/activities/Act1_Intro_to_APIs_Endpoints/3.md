<!--title={Using Postman to test http requests}-->

Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. 

Makes testing APIs super simple!



Let's use Postman to test what this route `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1` currently returns to the client.

On "Enter request url", copy and paste our route https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1 so Postman know which route to send our request to.

Click Send, and you should see the JSON data we get back through the response body as well as the **status code** (a code of 200 means a success!)

We just tested what the route does for a GET request!

If we wanted to test for POST, PUT, and DELETE, we would have to change the Request Type



Postman also supports authentication, an important aspect for many APIs.
