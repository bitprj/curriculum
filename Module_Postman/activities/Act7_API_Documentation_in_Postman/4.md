To document the APIs we used, simply copy and paste the API link onto the url box. Then you will want to write a nice, thoughtful description of the API in order for other developers to understand what the API is and how to use it.

 You will then want to leave the Method box as GET. To explain briefly, GET methods are just reading operations that allow the user GET or read/retrieve data from a database. And since all of our APIs did was retrieve data from the NASA database, they are all GET methods. After inputting in all of the APIs we used, it should look something like the following:

Once the following is done, we can now move on to the next step, which is to name our collection and give it a description like what we did for the various individual APIs.
