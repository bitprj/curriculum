More often than not, as a developer, one will be placed in a team of other developers. This in turn can lead to some misunderstandings and confusions when developing side by side with others as it can be difficult to understand other people's code at times. Also an API could be intended for public use for which documentation will play a significant role in others understanding and utilizing the API. Without proper documentation developers will struggle utilizing the API for its intended purpose.

To avoid that, doing API documentation can help improve one's understanding of whatever is going on in an application. This is because API documentation effectively tells other developer the tools one is using and how to use them. At the same time, API documentation is essential not just to other people, but to you as well.

If done right, it helps remind you of the various APIs you have used, and how to use them without the need to revisit and re-read various API documentations you have once already gone over.
