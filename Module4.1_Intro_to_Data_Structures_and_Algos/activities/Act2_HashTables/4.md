Hash table (hash map) is a kind of data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but sometimes it is possible that two keys will generate an identical hash causing both keys to point to the same bucket. They are known as **hash collisions**. 
> A bucket is simply a fast-access location (like an array index) that is the the result of the hash function.

The figure shows incidences of collisions in different table locations. We'll assign strings as our input data: [John, Janet, Mary, Martha, Claire, Jacob, and Philip]. Our hash table size is 6. As the strings are evaluated at input through the hash functions, they are assigned index keys (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). We store the first string John, then Janet and Mary. All is fine, but when we try to store Martha, the hash function assigns Martha the same index key as Janet. Now, because a second value is attempting to map to an already occupied index key, a collision occurs as seen in figure we've been using. Three out of the six locations are occupied, and the probability that the remaining strings yet to be loaded will cause other collisions is very high.



So we now return to the problem of collisions. When two items hash to the same slot, we must have a systematic method for placing the second item in the hash table. This process is called **collision resolution**. 



### How to handle Collisions?

There are mainly two methods to handle collision:

- 1) Separate Chaining
- 2) Open Addressing

We will elaborate further on these concepts in the following cards.
