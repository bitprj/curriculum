**Hashing** is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:

- In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.

- In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such as its exact position in the library or the users it has been issued to etc.

In both these examples the students and books were hashed to a unique number.

Assume that you have an object and you want to assign a key to it to make searching easy. To store the key/value pair, you can use a simple array like a data structure where keys (integers) can be used directly as an index to store values. However, in cases where the keys are large and cannot be used directly as an index, you should use *hashing*.

To truly appreciate hashing, one must have a basic understanding of Big-O notation and time complexity of algorithms, which you may have learned in the previous activity. Understanding Big-O notation allows one to know the worst-case time performance of certain algorithms or operations on a data structure, which can be important for a programmer in deciding which data structure to use. 

For our purposes, we will focus on **O(1)** time, which is Big-O notation for constant time. This means that the time that an algorithm takes to perform a certain procedure is **independent** of the size of the input.

## Hash function

In hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using **hash functions**. The values are then stored in a data structure called a **hash table**. The idea of hashing is to distribute entries (key/value pairs) uniformly across an array. Each element is assigned a key (converted key). By using that key you can access the element in **O(1)** time. **O(1)** in this context means that data can be accessed in constant time, regardless of how large our Hash Table is! Using the key, the algorithm (hash function) computes an index that suggests where an entry can be found or inserted.

The image below will show you an example about how hashing itself works.

Hashing is implemented in two steps:

1. An element is given an integer by using a hash function. This integer can be used as an index to store and access the original element, which falls into the hash table.

2. The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

   hash = hashfunc(key)
   index = hash % array_size

After performing these two steps, the hash is independent of the array size and it is then reduced to an index (a number between 0 and array_size − 1) by using the modulo operator (%). How can you can map data sets to each other no matter the size? That's where the hash function comes in.
> Reminder, the modulo operator (%) has two arguments and returns the remainder after division between the two numbers.

**Hash function**
A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

To achieve a good hashing mechanism, It is important to have a good hash function with the following basic requirements:

1. Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.

2. Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.

3. Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.

   **Note**: Irrespective of how good a hash function is, collisions are bound to occur. Therefore, to maintain the performance of a hash table, it is important to manage collisions through various collision resolution techniques.
