**Hash tables** are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function. A **hash function** is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called **hash values**. The values are used to index a fixed-size table which is the Hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called **hashing**.

That makes accessing the data faster as the index value behaves as a key for the data value. In other words, a Hash table stores key-value pairs but the key is generated through a hashing function.

 Thus, the search and insertion function of a data element becomes much faster as the key values themselves become the index of the array, which stores the data.For example, accessing data in Linked Lists could potentially take much longer, as one would have to loop through the list until the desired data is acquired. If you wished to find the last element in the list, you would have to go through the *entire* list!

 Detailed information about **Hashing** and **Hash function** will be displayed in 2.md.
