# Time and Space Complexity

# Long Summary

Algorithms require an input to run. As the input grows, learn about what happens to the memory usage and space usage. Learn about how to describe this rate.

# Short Summary

Learn about the different rates at which algorithm's memory usage and runtime increase

# Criteria

-Know what Time Complexity is, and the different rates of growth a function can have.

-What is Space Complexity? If one has to choose, what is of higher priority: space or time? Why?

-Create a function with O(n^2) time. How is it O(n^2)?

# Difficulty

Easy
