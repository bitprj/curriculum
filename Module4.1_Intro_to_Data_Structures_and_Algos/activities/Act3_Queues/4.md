# Example with Queue

We've gone over queues, but now lets take a look at an example. For this application, we can envision that we have people boarding into an airplane. Common courtesy in the plane is that the first people to board the plane get the first seats (towards the front of the plane). So let's load up our plane with 50 passengers:

> Note: we'll be using a list implementation of the queue.

```python
passengers = 50 #Total of the current 50 passengers on the plane
boardingPlane = Queue()
int(passengers) = 50

for x in range(passengers):
	boardingPlane.enqueue(x)
  
print(boardingPlane.size()) #result prints a size of 50
```

> Note: since 50 passengers is a lot to manually `enqueue()`, we can accomplish this in a concise way by using a for loop to iterate through 50 times to `enqueue()` them all.

Later in the day, the airplane lands at Sacramento International Airport. However, only the first 30 passengers in the front leave because the 20 passengers in the back will stay on for the connecting fight. The first 30 passengers corresponds to passengers 1 to 30 for the variable `frontPassengers` for our `boardingPlane`.

```python
frontPassengers = 30 #1st 30 passengers that left the plane
int frontPassengers = 30

for x in range(frontPassengers):
	boardingPlane.dequeue(x)

print(boardingPlane.size()) #result prints a size of 20
```
